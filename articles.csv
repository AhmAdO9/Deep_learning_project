JAIPUR: Heavy police arrangements were made across the city to catch revellers indulging in hullabaloo or breaching peace on the New Year eve on Tuesday. The police in the past two days arrested over 600 drunken drivers. Even as commissioner of police Bhupendra Dak inspected the city areas along with DCPs, official said that special focus was given to put a check on drunk driving. Policemen equipped with breathalyzers and interceptors were ready to catch hold of people driving in inebriated condition while passing through various areas in the city. "We are checking people, mostly youngsters for driving under the influence of alcohol on New Year Eve. All of them are being booked under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Their vehicles were seized and they are now to appear in courts concerned," said a senior police officer. Police added that these defaulters will either have to pay a fine or get at least three years of imprisonment. "Altogether 500 people driving vehicles including cars and bikes were caught at different places and their vehicles were seized on Monday night alone. Several others were penalized for high speed and for driving without helmets," the officer said. However, rowdies took the arrangements for granted and smashed the windows of a car parked near Gaurav Tower, Malviya Nagar area on Monday night.
JODHPUR: R P Meena, senior divisional commercial manager (DCM) of the Jodhpur Division of North Western Railways, who has been facing the charges of outraging the modesty of a female employee in his department, has been transferred by the railway authorities. Railway authorities confirmed Meena's transfer to the Rail Claims Tribunal at Jaipur following an order from R C Agarwal, GM, north-western railway, two days back. He was sent on leave by the department for 15 days and before he came back, he was transferred. A female railway ticket and reservation clerk had accused Meena of molestation and harassment. She had filed a complaint with the police on December 23 and had sought action against him. On the other hand, Jodhpur police has issued him notice to appear before the police for interrogation by Friday. "He has not yet appeared before the investigating officer and instead sent a written submission terming the complaint of molestation by the employee as a conspiracy against him. We have now shot off a notice asking him to appear before the investigating officer till Friday," said a police official. The official added that if Meena failed to appear in the stipulated time, a police team will be sent to arrest him. "We have given adequate time to him and he can not be allowed to escape the investigation," said the official.
NEW DELHI: Amid allegations and counter allegations between Arun Jaitley and Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh over the latter granting undue favours to a hydro power company in which his family allegedly got Rs 3.9 crore private loan, Singh accused the BJP leader of illegally securing his Income Tax (I-T) returns. The CM has threatened to file a defamation case against him. Singh accused Jaitley of levelling "wild" and "baseless" allegations and illegally procuring his I-T return details. "Arun Jaitely not only procured details of my Income Tax returns, which cannot be obtained even under RTI without the consent of the assesse, but also flashed them at a press conference in Shimla on October 23, 2010, withholding parts of it to suit his political agenda," Singh said. He said Jaitley had leveled same old charges of Income Tax Returns and giving favours to Ispat Industry by him. However, Jaitley remained unfazed and reacted to Singh's threat to sue him for indulging in "malicious campaign" to defame him. He posted on a social networking site: "Virbhadra Singh has said that he would consider filing a defamation action against me. He is certainly entitled to do so. In that event I would be pleading truth as defence and cross examining him on each of these issues". Claiming that he has ample evidence against the CM, Jaitley has asked Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to examine this and make a public declaration as to why they feel Singh is "still innocent". "The (Congress) party has challenged me to produce the evidence. The entire evidence is documentary and submitted both to the Prime Minister and the director CBI. The evidence is also available on my website." He has attached 20 documents claiming these to be as "evidence" in his letter to the PM," the Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha posted. Tuesday also saw workers of BJP's youth wing, headed by Anurag Thakur BJP MP from Himachal Pradesh, demonstrating outside Cong vice-president Rahul Gandhi's residence here. Singh, who appears to enjoy the backing of Congress leadership, hit back at the BJP by accusing the Opposition of running a malicious campaign against him In an eight-page statement, Singh accused BJP leaders of seeking to defend him since he led Congress to a win at their expense. "Frustrated BJP leaders are fabricating false stories and twisting and tampering facts to suit their convenience. They have been waging the same old issues pertaining to my income tax return and loan taken by my family, which have been replied and clarified time and again and there is nothing material or new in them," the CM said. He alleged that he was being targeted for exposing wrongdoings of previous BJP government, former CM Prem Kumar Dhumal and his son Anurag Thakur. "Desperate Dhumals have launched a full throttle vicious attack against me with an ill-intention of hurting my image and reputation and obstructing the progress of the Congress government in the state," he said. Singh said that after coming to power in Himachal, his government handed over a chargesheet to the state vigilance department and that hurting the BJP leaders. 
KOLKATA: The Mamata Banerjee government has added another feather in its cap. ITC Infotech has paid Rs 42 crore to the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) for the 16-acre plot in Rajarhat New Town allotted to them for setting foot in Bengal. With this, the IT major is all set to set up its first campus there. The decision to allot the land was taken in the state cabinet earlier. Hidco has already constructed a barbed wire fencing around the plot for the company. ITC Infotech approached the state government in 2005, seeking about 15 acres in Rajarhat for setting up their facility. Following the proposal, the government had earmarked about five acres. However, the then government suddenly made a U-turn. State IT minister Partha Chatterjee said that the government was working to further develop IT infrastructure and facilities in the state. He said that he would soon follow up with IT giants Wipro and Infosys to discuss on the status of their proposed campuses in Rajarhat New Town. Earlier this year, Chatterjee met Infosys executive co-chairman S Gopalakrishnan in the city. The state government had assured him that they will provide all kind of support to the IT major to set up its first campus in the city on the 50 acres allotted to them in Rajarhat. Sources said that the IT department was working on an incentive package for Infosys.
 KOLKATA: As the protest pitch against the death of 16-year-old gang-rape victim grew shriller, police on Tuesday said they are investigating a formal complaint against the R G Kar Medical College Hospital super for alleged negligence. The victimâs family has lodged two separate complaints against the hospital but it took the death of a victim for the police to break free from their stupor and act on them.  Meanwhile, when the body of the victim was being taken to Peace Heaven from RG Kar by the family members on Tuesday, police intercepted them and took the body straight to Nimtola crematorium.  According to sources, initially, the family came to Tala police station last Saturday and said that the hospital authorities were not allowing them to shift the girl. They also alleged that the girl was forced to lie in the hospital without getting a scope to be shifted to the specialized burn ward of SSKM that the kin felt could have offered better treatment.  âThe family had returned to the police station again on Tuesday after the death of the girl. This time, they gave us a written complaint saying they now want a case of medical negligence to be registered against the RG Kar Hospital. We are consulting the legal experts and if they give the nod, we will write to the state health department to form a medical board to probe the case. As per law, we will follow the findings of this case,â said a top officer. Kolkata Police has gone on record stating they have so far taken no statement from the victim.  The Airport police, too, didnât hide their discomfiture. Based on a statement by the girlâs mother on the December 23 suicide attempt, theyâve already started probe and arrested two persons named in the complaint â Minta Seal and Ratan Seal. Ratan and his mother, Bela, were the victimâs landlord, who according to the complaint were threatening to evict the family if they didnât withdraw the complaint. The police investigations here serve a pointer to how Minta had taken advantage of the family to put them up in a rented house near airport.  According to an investigator, the victim had first gone to Madhyamgram police station on October 26 and alleged that she was gang-raped the day before. The next day, prime accused Chottu Talukdar â who is a local fish seller â was arrested along with his five aides. On October 28, the victim again stepped into the police station to lodge another rape complaint. The second rape case is under probe. Meanwhile, a medical report from the Barasat state general hospital confirmed that the victim was raped. On December 17, police chargesheeted Chottu and the other five accused. ASP Bhaskar Bhattacharjee said, âThey have been booked under gang rape charges and all are in custody.â  Minta, police said, happened to know Chottu well. He disclosed this fact to the victim and her family when he helped them âscoutâ for a rented apartment. This apartment actually belonged to Chottuâs distant relative Bela and her son Ratan. They â along with Minta â had been putting pressure on them either to leave the place or withdraw charges, a reason probably leading to the suicide attempt.  The airport police said, âWe are concerned only with the suicide attempt made within our jurisdiction. We have the initial statement of the mother of the deceased and certain statements made by the victim in this regard. As for the allegations made by the mother about a murder attempt made on her daughter, we are ready to probe this angle too even though prima facie, we are yet to find any substantial evidence in this regard.â 
 NEW DELHI: UPA-II seems to be bracing for another barb from the Opposition for destroying investment sentiment of private players in highway development programme. Over 3,000 km highways awarded under the public private partnership (PPP) mode about two years ago are yet to take off for failure of both government and private parties.  With the ongoing tug-of-war among various government stakeholders â road transport, finance and environment ministries and planning commission â there is little hope of these projects taking off or getting rebid during this fiscal. Private developers are also looking to walk out of projects blaming NHAI of missing deadlines to provide promised land parcels and getting requisite clearances.  Former NHAI and road transport ministry officials, who had warned the government of "going overboard" on PPP and particularly the build-operate-transfer (BOT-toll) mode in 2005-06, now say that things seem to be getting out of hand. "We went ahead with plan of developing 85% projects on PPP mode and so all projects whether those were financially viable, unviable or very creamy projects lined up to get loan from banks and financial institutions. Projects bid out initially were successful when banks were inviting developers to take loan and there was little check," said a former NHAI member.  Now six-seven years later, things have changed completely when banks have become more stringent while providing loan and are insisting on 100% land availability as a pre-condition. Developers have blamed the dip in economic growth resulting reduction in traffic flow as one of the main reasons of projects becoming unviable.  NHAI has blamed other government bodies for delay in taking policy decisions. For example, there has been an 18-month lag by the environment and forests ministry to delink clearance and over eight months for rescheduling of Rs 1 lakh crore premium (earning spread over 20-30 years) for over two dozen projects due to stubborn stands of the Planning Commission and economic affairs department of the finance ministry.  Though the highways ministry had initially moved the proposal of scrapping the "troubled" premium projects and impose fine on developers for aggressive bidding, later it agreed to NHAI's proposal of premium rescheduling. Subsequently, it became free for all projects and the number of such ventures swelled to 48 during eight months.  But road ministry officials defended their stand and the effort to reschedule the premium payments by developers. "If we had not taken steps to salvage the projects we would have been blamed for failing to secure the promised revenue. In case we have no taker of the proposed rescheduling mechanism we will terminate contracts. The focus is on building road and not earning revenue," one official added. 
COIMBATORE: The Tirupur police on Monday arrested two school students for allegedly sexually assaulting a seven-year-old girl a few days ago. The students, studying in class 9 and 10 at two different government schools in Tirupur, told police that they committed the crime after watching porn movies in their friend's mobile phone. The boys have been lodged at the observation home for juveniles in the city. The victim, hailing from KVR Nagar in Tirupur city, is studying in class 2 at a private school in the same locality. The minor's parents are working with a textile unit in the city. After the school hours, the girl used to go to her grandmother's house at Gopal Nagar at KVR Nagar in Tiruppur city. On the evening of December 28, the victim was playing along with other children and the suspected boys, who were neighbours. The boys took the girl to an autorickshaw parked in an isolated place in the locality and physically assaulted her. Later, the duo left the girl near her grandmother's house. On Monday, the minor girl could not bear the pain and informed her mother about the incident. She approached all women police (south) and lodged a complaint against the boys. The police registered a case under section 376 (D) of the IPC and under section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012. The boys were arrested and lodged at the observation home situated at Lakshmi Mill junction in the city. "The duo told us that they had seen porn movies from one of their friend's mobile phone. After seeing the movies, they sexually assaulted the child," said inspector Bathurunnisha Begam, all women police station (south), Tirupur city. She also added that the victim was admitted at the Tirupur government hospital for medical test.
KOLKATA: On Bada Din (Christmas Day), he touched down on Kolkata without any 'dhoom'. Meet Sudeep Chatterjee, who kicked off his silver screen career as the cinematographer in Anjan Dutt's 'Bada Din' and zoomed his way to being the director of photography for 'Dhoom: 3'. He is now relaxing at his Behala home before shifting gear for his next project, Karan Johar's 'Shuddhi', starring Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor. "It would be a dream-come-true if I could live in Kolkata. I miss home terribly," sighs Sudeep, who was behind the camera in Buddhadev Dasgupta's National Film Award-winner 'Kalpurush'. "The problem in Tollywood is that the dates are set very late. I'm booked till 2015-end. If I get an interesting script, of course I'm willing," he says. It's been just a week since the release of 'Dhoom 3' and it has not only broken box office records in India but also in Pakistan and Nepal. Was this madness expected? "While shooting, you don't look at the commercial prospects. But it was tremendously expensive to shoot the movie and we were under pressure to deliver. Creative satisfaction is most important to me but the insane returns the film is getting is indeed heart-warming." Sudeep had enrolled in an engineering course but quit after eight months to join FTII Pune. "In 1994, Vidhu Vinod Chopra came to FTII and he was impressed with a video I had shot. While I was in Kolkata for vacation, I got a call, telling me Chopra is looking for me. He wanted an apprentice during the shooting of '1942: A Love Story' and also wanted me to shoot the making of the film." After FTII, Sudeep returned to Kolkata. "I knew that eventually I would have to shift to Mumbai, so I wanted to stay as long as possible here. It was while mulling when to shift that 'Bada Din' happened. After that I went to Mumbai to look for work. I stayed with Pritam, who was a sound recordist then," he recounts. Six months later he came to Kolkata and returned to Mumbai with his wife and daughter, who just a few months old. "Imagine, though I did manage to get an apartment there, I still had no work. Finally I got some good offers for TV shows. I also did 'Star Bestsellers' with Tigmanshu Dhulia. Now I wonder I dared to set off like that," Says Sudeep. Then came his Bollywood debut. "It was really funny. My wife woke me up and said, 'Someone called Ramu is calling.' Ramu? I was confused. I took the call and it turned out to be Ram Gopal Verma.He wanted me to work for 'Road'." Then came 'Kyun! Ho Gaya Na...' with Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai, and the Salman Khan-starrer 'Lucky: No Time for Love'. He next worked with Buddhadev Dasgupta for 'Kalpurush', then Nagesh Kukunoor for the critically-acclaimed 'Iqbal'. "But Chak De! India proved to be a game-changer. Among the following projects, I really enjoyed filming Sanjay Leela Bansali's 'Guzaarish'," says Sudeep.For the last few years, Sudeep has filtered down to one film a year. "I went for a long holiday after 'Guzaarish' and spoke to Adi (Aditya Chopra) about 'Dhoom: 3'. He didn't take me seriously at first as I didn't work on the two earlier 'Dhoom' movies," he laughs out loud. Having worked with Aamir, Shah Rukh and Salman Khan as well as Hrithik, what would he say about Bollywood's Fab Four? "SRK is instinctive, Aamir is deliberate, planned. While I have a lot in common with SRK, I bond really well with Aamir intellectually. During 'Chak De!', there was a lot of fun, including football matches among the entire team. With Aamir, it was more cerebral - we went cycling, and to museums. Salman is 100% entertainment. Hrithik is one of the nicest persons I've met. He feels that I shoot him really well, so after 'Guzaarish', most of his ad films have been shot by me."
COIMBATORE: A co-ordination meeting is expected to be scheduled at the city municipal corporation office in the first week of January to discuss important civic projects. The main focus of the meeting would be the structural and alignment alterations, if needed, for the monorail project to be implemented in the city. This meeting is expected to be the first official meeting in which the project will be discussed after the chief minister announced the initial proceedings for implementing the project a couple of days back. "The city corporation would be convening the meeting which will include all major departments carrying out engineering works in the city like PWD and electricity board," said M Murugesan, divisional enginner, Coimbatore state highways. The meeting is expected to be scheduled either on coming Wednesday or Thursday and will have senior officials representing corporation, PWD, Tangedco, BSNL, TWAD and other departments. "The meeting will be to discuss the integrated bus terminus project in which we will have to co-ordinate and discuss about the entry and exit points. The mono rail project provisions will also be discussed," said S Sivarasu, deputy commissioner, Coimbatore municipal corporation. The state government had announced the mono rail project after it was an integral part of the poll manifesto of the AIADMK in the recent state assembly elections. Earlier the DMK regime had indicated that metro rail system would be implemented in Coimbatore. However Chief Minsiter J Jayalalithaa announced in Chennai for conducting a feasibility survey project for monorail system in Coimbatore.
 NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Arup Raha, who took over as the 24th chief of IAF on Tuesday, will have to push for faster induction of new fighters, helicopters, mid-air refuelling aircraft and the like if his force eventually has to become a truly "expeditionary" aerospace power.  His predecessors have set the course for IAF to progressively become capable of swiftly deploying and operating in India's expanding strategic environment spreading from Persian Gulf right up to Malacca Strait, and beyond.  As per projections, India will spend another $35 billion over the next 10 years to boost its air combat power. IAF is already the world's fourth-largest air force after the US, Russia and China, and clocks over 2,30,000 hours of flying every year.  But there is also the grim reality that close to half its fighter fleet is made of aging and obsolete fighters like MiG-21s and MiG-27s, which add up to over 300 jets. Moreover, its inventory of 27 types of aircraft, including six different fighters and eight helicopters, also poses a huge logistical and maintenance challenge.  ACM Raha realizes his work is cut out for his almost three-year tenure. "IAF is on a trajectory of modernisation. It's transforming into a strategic aerospace power with full spectrum capability. Accretion through new acquisitions, replacement of obsolete equipment with state-of-the-art inductions and upgrade of the vintage weapon platforms will bolster our capabilities," he said, taking over from ACM N A K Browne.  While India just last week inked another $1.01 billion contract to acquire six more C-130J "Super Hercules" aircraft from the US, after earlier ordering six C-130Js and 10 C-17 Globemaster-III strategic airlift aircraft, the sharp fall in the number of fighter squadrons remains a big worry.  IAF is down to just 34 fighter squadrons (16 to 18 jets each) when at least 44 are needed to be comfortable against China and Pakistan. A booster dose is also required for its aging helicopter fleets, air defence systems and radars.  Though India is steadily inducting the 272 Sukhoi-30MKI fighters contracted from Russia for around $12 billion, the almost $20 billion MMRCA (medium multi-role combat aircraft) project to acquire 126 new fighter jets will remain a top priority for ACM Raha. The deal for French Rafale fighters â first 18 jets to be imported, rest licensed produced by Hindustan Aeronautics over six years â is nowhere being inked despite the technical and commercial evaluation process beginning way back in August 2007.  ACM Raha will also have to make certain the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, which finally received its initial operational clearance recently, is inducted in its fully-weaponized version as soon as possible.  Then, there is also India's biggest defence project in the making, the critical joint development of the stealth fifth-generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) with Russia, which has run into turbulence. Under this gigantic project, India will eventually end up spending close to $35 billion over the next two decades to induct over 200 such "swing-role" fighters. 
COIMBATORE: Around 100 nurses working with the primary health care centres in Erode staged a dharna in the city on Tuesday demanding promotions and better working environment. A Malarvizhi Chandralekha, an office bearer of the Village Nurses Association said the nurses associated with the Primary Health Centres (PHCs) have been denied their promotion for several years. "Most of us are working for more than 30 years without a single promotion," she said. There are around 350 nurses in the PHCs which are mostly located in rural areas. They are working in the same position in which they were recruited, she said. At the same time the workload and living expenses have gone up. "We are forced to shell the expenses for the rent and the electricity bill of the building from our meagre salary. For the last two years the amount has not been reimbursed to us," she said. As per rule there should be one PHC for a population of 5,000 and now the population has increased to up to 40,000. The increase in work load has compounded with the government refusal to fill the vacant posts in several PHCs, she said. The nurses alleged that recently the government decided to appoint diploma holders as supervisors. "Around 770 diploma nurses were appointed in 2005 as part of the National Rural Health Mission. They were expected to be promoted to the government hospitals as staff nurses. But now the government plans to keep them as supervisors," she said. Malarvizhi said the sub-centres should be upgraded as government hospitals and the nurses should be promoted as supervisors.
BANGALORE: Private company employee Sarah (name changed) was attacked by a suspected stalker in broad daylight in her house in the city. She lodged a police complaint and ever since has been making rounds of the police station to inquire about the status of the probe. But all she has in hand is an acknowledgement slip. Tired of this ordeal, Sarah asked why she wasn't getting any SMS alert on the status of her complaint. "I was told stalking doesn't come under SMS alert system," she says, wondering why should there be a system at all when it has failed to deliver. Sarah's plight is shared by thousands of complainants and others seeking police services like document verifications. Police officers admit that the SMS gateway system, introduced over a year ago to enhance transparency and efficiency of service delivery, hasn't been able serve its purpose. The system envisaged sending SMS alerts to complainants and those requesting other services on the progress of the plaint or the request. According to official statistics, 2,500-3,000 SMSs are generated daily under the system across the state. Police believe the project has a capacity to generate 10,000 SMSs. Explaining the huge deficit, Praven Sood, ADGP, who also holds the additional charge of police computer wing, says, "In some cases, we are lethargic, and sometimes people are unaware of the system." According to Sood, around 1.5 lakh FIRs are registered across the state every year, and at least 20 lakh service requests are made to police. Given the rule that every FIR should be converted into a charge-sheet within two months, at least three lakh SMSs should generated every year, taking the total number to 23 lakh SMSs a year, translating into over 6,500 SMSs daily. Sood claims that in many cases people are reluctant to share their mobile numbers with police, leading to non-generation of SMSs.DECODING THE SMS SYSTEM With the digitization of police records, every time a case is registered with the cops or any service request application such as job or passport verification is filed, a unique 15-digit code is generated. The code is similar to the PNR number of a railway ticket and can be used to track the status of the case or the service request. In case of a police complaint, the complainant will get an SMS update at every stage of the FIR lifecycle. The first SMS is generated on filing of a complaint. Later, based on three categories of action taken on the complaint - A Report (chargesheet filed), B Report (lack of evidence) and C Report (closure), another SMS will be sent to the complaint. The final SMS will be sent when the case is closed. Apart from complaints, the SMS facility covers 21 services provided by police. These include issuance and renewal of arms licenses, report of a missing person, mobile theft report et al.  The enterprise management solution also makes it possible to track why a case is delayed or where is the file stuck and for what reasons.IN A NUTSHELL * 1.5 lakh complaints filed with police every year * 20 lakh service requests made * 23 lakh should be the minimum number of SMSs generated as 1.5 lakh plaints should result in at least a chargesheet each within 90 days * 6,500 SMSs need to be generated if all these complaints and service requests are considered * 2,500-3000 SMSs are being generated every dayElectronic file transfer between HC and police department A first-of-its-kind programme initiated by the Karnataka high court and state police is set to reduce dependency on the postal system. The new system will do away with personnel physically requiring to transfer documents, thus minimizing delay in communication. The initiative, a pilot project, will see the high court and police servers synced to share real-time data, resulting in all FIRs and charge-sheets automatically being uploaded on the HC server. Eventually, information received by the HC server will be transferred to jurisdictional courts, expediting the trial process and ensuring speedy delivery of justice. To be rolled out in January 2014, the system is expected to reduce the burden on the already understaffed police. The second phase, expected to be implemented by April, will see every police station getting connected to its respective court. Additional director general of police Praveen Sood said the project will enable police to have an online acknowledgement for every FIR submitted to the court. "Our laws are such that they need a physical copy of the FIR signed by a judge. We'll have to amend the law. However, technologies like e-pens are available, which can replace these methods," he explained.
COIMBATORE: The city corporation is planning to save big time on LPG cylinders at its budget Amma canteen in Saravanampatti with the bio methanation unit at the eatery that was inaugurated on Tuesday. The unit with a capacity of 0.25 tonne is expected to bring down LPG dependency of the canteen according to corporation officials. Apart from the kitchen waste generated from the canteen itself, the civic body is also using organic kitchen waste from seven different units including from the kitchen functioning inside a software park in the vicinity to fuel up its bio gas plant. The methanation unit was proposed to be set up at the Amma canteen unit as part of the corporation's initiative to focus on alternative energy forms in its major projects. The canteen, according to officials, on an average generates about 30 kg of organic waste from its own kitchen. The remaining quantity of waste is diverted from the private eateries and canteens in the region. "Earlier, we used to collect the organic waste from these places and take it to Vellalore dump yard after transporting it to the transfer station on Sathy Road. Now we are directly bring it to the bio-methanation unit," said a corporation official. The corporation has spent Rs 10 lakh for setting up the plant and, as per the trial run conducted last week, it is producing 16 to 17 kg of methane gas, which is almost equivalent to the capacity of a normal LPG cylinder. The canteen requires one LPG cylinder on a daily basis which is expected to dip drastically if the bio-methanation plant is put into effective and consistent use at the canteen.
 KOLKATA/DANTAN: Itâs official now. Moghulmari has the oldest archaeological site in Bengal dating back to 6th century AD.  The state archaeology department that started re-excavating the site confirmed that it houses the oldest Buddhist vihara (monastery) in Bengal. Located a few kilometers from Dantan in West Midnapore, the Moghulmari site will force historians to rewrite the history of Buddhist civilization in Bengal.  The recent discovery of a coin and a locket by archaeologists at the excavation site has put the date of the vihara back to the time of Maharaja Samachar Devo, an independent ruler of Bengal during the time of Kumar Gupta of the Gupta dynasty.  The coins were brought to the city for verification and the state archaeology department confirmed on Tuesday that the engravings on the coin have been deciphered and dates back to the sixth century. âThe discovery of the coin proves that the monastery proliferated during the 6th century AD, making it the oldest Buddhist vihara of Bengal,â confirmed Amal Roy, deputy director of the department. Letters on the coin belong to the Brahmi script, he added.  Interestingly, the story of the Moghulmari site has found a special mention in the history textbook of Class VI of Madhyamik Board and will be introduced in schools from the coming academic session. Atanu Pradhan, spokesperson of Moghulmari villagers, who had helped excavators since 2004, said that the school education department was requested to include this chapter.  Calcutta University started excavating the site in 2004 and did it in phases till 2012 to arrive at the conclusion that a Buddhist vihara existed beneath the massive mound of Moghulmari. However, due to lack of funds and other infrastructural shortcomings, the varsity could not continue excavating and the archaeology department took it over on November 20. The coin and the locket are the two big discoveries that have finally, put a stamp to the ethnicity of the vihara, gradually emerging from the mound.  It is a massive vihara, older and far bigger than the Raktamrittika vihara of Murshidabad, which was so long considered to be the oldest Buddhist shrine in Bengal.  The structure is of a âtri-rathaâ type typical of Buddhist monastic architecture complete with innumerable cells for monks. âBesides royal patronage, the monastery was patronized by merchants, who used the Dantan portâ, said Rajat Sanyal, an archaeologist of CU.  âThe monastery was indeed built in the Vajrayana phase of Buddhist propagation. During this time, deity worship was slowly making inroads into Buddhism,â said archaeologist Durga Basu. 
COIMBATORE: Claiming that they have received an assurance from officials of the transport department and district administration announcing minimum fares for auto rickshaw in the city soon, the auto rickshaw unions have decided to postpone their decision to start running as per their own proposed rates. Earlier all major auto rickshaw unions except the AIADMK affiliate one had decided to operate in Coimbatore with RS 30 for 1.5 km as minimum fare with Rs 15 for every additional fare claiming that the government was delaying the announcement of minimum fare. The auto unions claimed that they will now implement the new fares only after January 10 in the district. "We convened a meeting of representatives from all unions and have decided to give some more time to the government and district administration. We have been assured that the government announcement will come in the first week of January. So we will wait till January 10," said PK Sukumaran, president, District Federation of Autorikshaw Unions. The auto rickshaw union started distributing their own fare cards to the auto drivers with Rs 30 as the minimum fare to the drivers in the city. Officials from the transport and traffic police departments had strongly warned them citing that the unions did not have the power to fix their own fares. The state government had earlier announced Rs 25 for 1.8 km as the minimum fare in Chennai with Rs 12 for every additional kilometre. The auto rickshaw unions have been opposing this rate here in Coimbatore and pushing for higher rates and also exerting pressure on the authorities to implement it. They argued that the number of passengers in Coimbatore is less compared to Chennai city and autos cannot run with same rate fixed for Chennai city.
NEW DELHI: The new Land Acquisition Act, enacted by Parliament in September to provide just and fair compensation to those whose land is taken away for constructing roads, buildings or factories, will come into force from Wednesday, replacing 120-year-old legislation. The Act, meant for bringing transparency to the process of acquisition of land, provides for generous compensation and rehabilitation of those affected by the takeover. The new law â Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act â stipulates mandatory consent of at least 70% of affected people for acquiring land for Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects and 80% for acquiring land for private companies. Now, state governments will have to set up at least six bodies, including the state-level Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Authority, to hear disputes arising out of projects where land acquisition has been initiated by the state or its agencies. As per rules made by the ministry, the state governments should take immediate steps to create and establish the State Social Impact Assessment Unit, the office of the Commissioner Rehabilitation and Resettlement and the State Level Monitoring Committee. The new law was enacted as the archaic Act of 1894 suffered from various shortcomings including silence on the issue of resettlement and rehabilitation of those displaced by land acquisition. Under the new legislation, compensation for the owners of the acquired land will be four times the market value in rural areas and twice in urban areas. It also stipulates that the land cannot be vacated until the entire compensation is awarded to the affected parties. The law has the provision that the companies can lease the land instead of purchasing it. Besides, the private companies will have to provide for rehabilitation and resettlement if land acquired through private negotiations is more than 50 acres and 100 acres in urban and rural areas, respectively. 
 Apu. This became a household name in Bengal thanks to Pather Panchali. Apu was an alter ego of Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay: playing in the kashbon, his father dying in his childhood, working at a printerâs shop, much of what had happened in the authorâs life got translated into incidents in the narrative that rocketed Satyajit Ray into international fame. He could not, then, stop with Pather Panchali: Aparajito and Apur Sansar had to take Apuâs story to its logical culmination.  But Subir Banerjee? âWhoâs that?â â you might wonder. Heâs the actor who played Apu in that watershed in the history of world cinema. Most people think the character was named after the actor â so convincing was the portrayal of the iconic protagonist. But why was he not seen in the sequential titles? Apur Sansar opened the floodgate of roles for Soumitra Chatterjee, but why wasnât Subir Banerjee in the credit titles of any film since the âSong of the Roadâ was celebrated at Cannes full 58 years ago? Therein lies the story that has won Kaushik Ganguly the first of what could be a long list of awards â the Best Director at IFFI 2013.  Apur Panchali germinated at a wedding where someone pointed out a guest and said, âThis is Pather Panchaliâs âApuâ.â Subir Banerjee is now 68, and yet we all think of him as the child wearing a crown made of aluminium foil and zipping through the kashbon to catch a glimpse of a passing train. âThat brought me a series of names who played iconic roles as unsuspecting kids, and then were lost in oblivion- be it Chaplinâs The Kid or DeSicaâs Bicycle Thief. It suddenly struck me that a film gives a child artiste nothing but a mask â that of the character,â says Kaushik.  When the director sought out the subject of Apur Panchali, he found Subir Banerjee most reluctant to talk about âthe burden of bearing a fame that never became hisâ. But the more Kaushik listened to him, the more he realised that âSubir played Apu and moved on in life, but the story of Apu would not leave him. Somehow, his own life continued to echo events in Apuâs story.â Subirâs fatherâs sudden death, his own wedding to a friendâs cousin, her death following childbirth, Subir throwing away the taveez after her death: If that parallel life allured Kaushik into penning this script, the international jury comprising Goran Paskaljevic, Victor Banerjee, Claire Dennis, Prasanna Vithanage and Atiq Rahimi were âallured by the human aspect of the film.â  Kaushik seems to be specialising in breaking the traditional format again and again. Arekti Premer Galpo had four actors living eight lives â their own and that of the characters theyâre filming. Apuâs Song has documentary and fiction coming together with film clips to create an experience thatâs neither docu nor drama but both! You have three strands then â one, the story of Rayâs Apu; two, the story of Subir Banerjee in his youth; and finally, the 68-year-old who is indifferent, even rude when he is invited to Berlin to be honoured as one of the 10 most iconic child actors of the world.  This layered narrative could prove ambitious if any viewer walks in without seeing the âApu Trilogyâ. Fortunately, three of the IFFI jury members had seen all the three Ray films while the other two had seen one or the other. They were all highly impressed that the director had not complicated the story with either technique or technology. Instead, he has poignantly brought out the deeply buried sense of hurt in the actor who was replaced by Pinaki Sengupta in Aparajito.  Did the maestro lose confidence in his actor? Did he think he would be self-conscious if he was cast again? Who knows! But one thing is known to this writer: When Ray passed away, Subir was among those who walked behind his bier, from Basusree to Nandan, along with Sandip Ray and Taradas Bandopadhyay, son of the original âApuâ â Bibhuti Bhushan. But while on Apu, letâs not forget to celebrate Ardhendu Banerjee. He hasnât put on a mask â he has actually got under the skin of Subir Banerjee. Hereâs hoping to see him in many more titlesâ¦ 
 HOWRAH: Five states, including West Bengal, will step up vigilance along the 4,096-km border they together share with Bangladesh 24 hours before the general elections in that country on January 5.  Union home secretary Anil Goswami took stock of the border security during a three-hour meeting with chief minister Mamata Banerjee and senior state officials and the additional director general of BSF at Nabanna on Tuesday. The continuing violence in the run-up to the Bangladesh general elections has prompted the Delhi bosses to take up the security questions with stakeholders â states and the BSF â seriously.  The ADG (BSF) in his report to the Union home secretary pointed out that of the 2,216-km border that Bengal shares with Bangladesh, the 345-km riverine border in the Sunderbans remains vulnerable because there is no fencing. The report says 70% of the land border is fenced.  The state and the BSF have been asked to increase patrol on the riverine belt and check all houses there. The state has asked for Rs 138 crore central funds to beef up security along the Sunderbans border. It has proposed to set up a radar centre to improve monitoring and arranging police training for local fishermen so that they can defend themselves against incursions from the Bangladesh side.  Goswami reached the secretariat at 11.55am and stayed there till 3pm, holding meetings. âWe discussed the law and order situation, among several things. The state has asked for funds. It will give specific proposals,â he said emerging from the meeting with the CM.  State home secretary Basudeb Banerjee said: âWe talked about Bangladesh elections and security in border areas.â  Goswami also alerted the government on the Kamtapur Liberation Organisationâs expansion plans in North Bengal. He gave some intelligence inputs to the state in the wake of the Jalpaiguri blast. Ten years after KLO shifted its camps out of Mainaguri and Dhupguri in Jalpaiguri following Operation Flushout in 2003, KLO activists are making a fresh bid to gain a toehold in the district because it helps them maintain contacts with Nepal and Bhutan from where they are being trained.  The Union home secretary is not discounting fresh Maoist activities in Jangalmahal either. The state plans to set up 45 well-equipped police stations at crucial locations in Jangalmahal. 
BANGALORE: The war to fix potholes on city roads that frequently proved fatal to motorists is as much about infrastructure logistics as about mindsets. A demonstration of a pothole-filling machine that has been tasked with the job of leveling out the craters on the city roads ran into display of witnessed apathy from corporators here on Tuesday. About 30 councilors had demanded the demonstration but only a handful turned up for it. On Monday, several corporators had demanded at the BBMP council meeting that the contract of pothole-filler Python 5,000 - a machine given by American Road Technology and Solutions Private Limited (ARTS) - be scrapped as it was incapable of doing the job efficiently and the contract cost of Rs 17 crore was too high. The machine arrived at Nrupathunga Road in the morning and was there till noon but only around five councilors came to watch the demonstration. BBMP officials informed ARTS that councilors would view the demonstration near Hudson Circle at 2pm. The machine was moved to the new venue but no corporator showed up for the demo. As a result, the machine, which can fix about 50 potholes a day, lay idle for most of the day. Moreover, officials had to keep boiling bitumen mix ready through the day for the demonstration that never happened. M G Mohan Kumar, director of ARTS, said the machine can fill potholes within a short time and can be operated by one or two personnel. Filling a pothole manually requires at least five men and consumes a lot of time, he pointed out. Mayor B S Sathyanarayana said the councilors couldn't make it to the demo on Tuesday but would witness the demonstration another day.About Python 5,000 * It fills a pothole with a hot bitumen mix within three to 10 minutes * The cost of this machine is Rs 2.7 crore * Till date, it has filled more than 2,000 potholes in the city * It was inaugurated by chief minister Siddaramaiah on November 16 * As per the contract entrusted to ARTS by BBMP, the machine has to fill all potholes on the 1,940km length of roads across the city within a year
 NEW DELHI: The Union environment ministry has indicted ONGC for oil spill that was reported off the Uran coast near Mumbai in October. It has asked the petroleum ministry to take action against those responsible for not adhering to the crucial monitoring norms in the public sector oil major despite repeated directions issued to it expressing similar concerns in the past.  The ONGC, which comes under the petroleum ministry, was indicted on the basis of a report submitted by an inspection team comprising experts from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which found that the poor maintenance of pipelines and negligence shown by its handlers had led to the spill causing severe environmental damage to the coastal area.  Citing the team's findings, the then environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan had even written a note to petroleum minister M Veerappa Moily last month expressing her concerns over such negligence.  Natarajan had also urged Moily to direct quick installation of IT-based monitoring system to prevent such spills. Both the ministries now come under Moily who will have to unravel the 'systemic failure' that led to these incidents in many parts of the country.  The green ministry had last month also issued a 'direction' to the ONGC under Section 5 of the Environmental Protection Act, asking it why such pipeline can't be closed for repeatedly causing oil spill. Though the oil company responded to its direction, it failed to convince 'babus' in the green ministry about the sincerity of its action due to past record.  The 'direction' was issued on the basis of the report of the inspection team under CPCB member secretary J S Kamyotra that blamed the public sector firm for ignoring many similar directions in the past. The ministry had noted three such oil spills in the past one year.  Besides the oil spill at Mumbai-Uran Trunk oil pipeline following a rupture in ONGC's main pipeline in October, another spill had been reported in the coastal areas of Gulf of Khambhat following damage in the oil company's pipeline near Bhadbhut village of Bharuch district, Gujarat, in August.  In November 2012, a pipeline carrying crude oil for refining developed cracks and spilt oil in about 100 acres of farmland in a village in Tamil Nadu's Nagapattinam district.  A senior official said, "The environment ministry had written to the petroleum ministry on all these occasions. Though the ONGC had replied to our notes, it did not take adequate action to prevent such incidents which has not only damaged local flora and fauna but also severely affected the aquatic life".  Details submitted by the team that inspected the oil spill site near Mumbai in October pointed out that the leaked oil along the Uran shoreline, from Mora to Karanja villages, had affected local fishermen and damaged the soil in large track of land.  The official said that though the petroleum ministry had set up an IT-based monitoring system, it failed to cover the entire stretch carrying underground oil pipeline.  "The environment ministry has consistently been raising the issue, but it does not seem to be a priority of the petroleum ministry. We will raise this issue to the new minister who may now, hopefully, appreciate our concerns," said the official. 
BANGALORE: The absence of a mechanism to market Kannada movies is hindering their reach to a larger audience, feel directors P Sheshadri, T S Nagabharana and Anand P Raju. The trio expressed their views at an interaction with the press organized as part of the 6th Bangalore International Film Festival (Biffes) on Tuesday. Sheshadri, who opened the discussion, said not only has the number of Kannada films increased over the years, but their quality too has improved manifold. "However, marketing of movies remains a major concern for filmmakers. I want film festivals such as Biffes to take up the issue from next year and help market Kannada movies. This will enable their foray into the international market." Sheshadri also took exception to the non-screening of movies selected for Panorama (International Film Festival of India) at the Film Bazaar organized by the National Film Development Corporation. "Film Bazaar attracts people who market movies but Panorama is limited only to delegates. Movies selected for Panorama should also be screened at the Film Bazaar to help their marketing.'' Nagabharana observed that though Kannada movies have a limited market, they have made a name internationally because of their quality. He felt a movement was necessary to promote, market and make Kannada movies. Finnish filmmaker Taru Makela explained how it's difficult to market films even in Finland. "Local movies have to compete with Hollywood productions. Because of this, it's difficult to market Finnish movies. Besides, many theatres are reserved for Hollywood movies,'' she said. Explained N Vidyashankar, deputy artistic director: "We can create visibility for movies only by screening them. We cannot do much beyond that.'' Referring to Sheshadri's demand to screen each Kannada movie twice during the fest, festival artistic director H N Naraharirao said there are only five slots to screen the movies. "It's very difficult to get slots. Besides, we are short of funds and theatres as well," he said.
BANGALORE: New Year Eve revelry seems to be undergoing a paradigm shift if the celebrations that marked the ushering in of 2014 are any indication. While the celebrations were a wee bit muted in CBD areas, it was unbridled fun, boozing and partying as one went away from the heart of the city. From clubs and pubs to houses on the periphery to resorts on the outskirts, there was no holding back. Tuesday dawned with anticipation as work places recorded fall in attendance and everyone discussed where to head for the eve that they had been waiting for a year. But the nerve centre of boisterous revelry in the city, M G Road, remained subdued till 10pm. But the adjacent Brigade Road brimmed with life and verve, though not on the scale it was at that hour exactly one year earlier. The mood elsewhere in the city though was upbeat from morning. The excitement was palpable at pubs, bars and food joints across the city as the day wore on. Sajit Chacko, owner, Cloud Bar, said: "We have got over 300 to 400 enquiries alone since morning and seeing the interest we expect to reach full capacity by 8.30pm."Good response at bars: Kay, partner at Island, Zero G, and Banana Beach Bar, said: "The response this year has been better than last year. We are almost sold out across our three properties of Island, Banana Beach Bar and Zero G. In fact, Island in Indiranagar, which has the capacity to accommodate 900 people, was completely sold out on Monday itself. Kay said that the New Year celebrations across his three properties were priced between Rs 4,000 and Rs 6,000 per couple, which includes unlimited drinks and food. By late afternoon, policemen began clearing vehicles parked by the roadside in CBD areas. Patrol vehicles began zooming around, equipped with public address systems announcing the vehicle movement and parking curbs in place. Gun and camera-toting policemen mounted the 12-foot-tall steel watch towers set up at 30 spots in CBD areas. DCP (Central) Ravikanthe Gowda, supervising the security arrangements at the M G Road-Brigade Road junction, admitted that the reveller crowds were sparser.All the way to Bangalore: Once dusk set in and colourful lights vibrantly lit up Brigade Road, pavement began brimming with people. Youths sitting in front of the shops on Brigade Road began the exciting wait for the clock to strike 12, to wish there beloved ones. A sprinkling of revellers had come from elsewhere to the city too. Rithika Sharma, an MBA student from Delhi, said "For four years now, I have been having my New Year bash in Goa, but this year I came to meet my cousin and to party in Bangalore, which is one of the safest party destinations in the country." Around 11pm as Brigade Road became jam-packed, policemen were on a high alert to ensure safety for the revellers. Many youths with colourful balloons and glittering masks equipped with lights welcomed 2014 by screaming "happy new year" as the clock ticked to 12. Sharan Somanna, an executive with a tea company in Munnar, said he had come down to his hometown Bangalore only to usher in 2014. "We had planned this party months ago and have gathered at a friend's place in Nagarbhavi. We are here with our families. We did not want to go out because we wanted the occasion to be a family affair. Besides, we are keen that the best way to ring in the New Year would be with a safe and environment-friendly part," said Sharan. Revellers of all age groups began trooping in strength down MG Road, Brigade Road, Kamaraj Road and Church Street. Raghavendra P, a IT professional, who was accompanied by his wife and six-year-old son, said, "I just came with my family to take a walk on MG Road and Brigade Road. These roads are soaked in festive mood like every year."Farmhouses are full: Hundreds of party freaks were headed out of the city to party with their friends in farmhouses along Mysore-Bangalore Road, Kanakpura and in Sarjapur. Jaydev Kumar, an employee in an insurance company, said, "We went for a drive across the prominent roads of the city and now I am partying with my friends at a farmhouse in Kanakapura, as it is safer." Many youths were seen piling up takeaways in their vehicles as they preferred to house party on the occasion. HM Kashyap, an engineering graduate, said he is partying in his friend's place in J P Nagar as it is more convenient. "We can play whatever music we want at home," he said.
BANGALORE: The state government has yet again decided to seek the opinion of the advocate general and experts before deciding on 'G' category BDA sites. Recently, the cabinet sub-committee held a meeting to study recommendations of Justice B Padmaraj committee report which has asked the government to cancel and reclaim 308 sites allotted under the chief minister's discretionary quota between 2004 and 2011. During the status review of these sites, the sub-committee found that sizeable plots have either been sold or houses constructed on them. "We are unable to decide what to do with these sites. There are also apprehensions that some people may approach the court asking it to direct the government to take back sites that were allotted before 2004, once we reclaim the 300-odd sites in question," a senior minister told TOI. Chief minister Siddaramaiah constituted a committee comprising ministers TB Jayachandra, RV Deshpande, HK Patil and Ramalinga Reddy to decide on the future course of action on the court order. This after the BDA and urban development department weren't able to find a solution to issue. While interpreting the single and division benches orders of the Karnataka HC with regard to G-category sites, differences in opinion cropped up. "We want more clarity on the judgment and hence opinion of legal experts has been sought," the minister said. Another fear is that beneficiaries cutting across party lines have threatened to go to court seeking scrapping of allotments made prior to 2004. However, on paper several MLAs and former ministers have maintained that they are ready to return the allotted site to the government if the cabinet decides to take back the land. The Padmaraj Commission, which was set up by the government in October 2012 following a high court direction on a petition on G-category BDA site allotment, has recommended the government take back illegal allotments. Leaders like Prahlad Joshi, R Roshan Baig, minister Shivaraj S Thangadgi, Murugesh R Nirani, DV Sadananda Gowda, DN Jeevraj, a high court justice and several other officials are beneficiaries of G-category sites.VARIOUS CATEGORIES The stray sites are allotted under various categories according to the circular issued on August 6, 1997: * Cat A: Disposal by auction - 30% * Cat B: Persons who have won special recognition in the field of sports at intentional/national levels (Karnataka domicile) - 15% * Cat C: Persons who have won special recognition in the fields of arts, science, literature, education, medicine and public administration at the national/international levels - 10% * Cat D: Ex-military personnel, military personnel (Karnataka domicile) - 5% * Cat E: Freedom fighters who have been residents of Bangalore for a period of not less than 10 years - 5% * Cat F: Dependents of Karnataka government servants, in case the latter dies during the performance of his/her duty - 5% * Cat G: Persons in public life as may be directed by the government - 30%UNDER THREAT If allotments prior to 2004 are questioned, 1,128 beneficiaries will be in trouble. These sites were allotted by various CMs under G-category between August 6, 1997 and 2011. *JH Patel - 222 sites *SM Krishna - 334 sites *N Dharam Singh - 76 sites *HD Kumaraswamy - 286 sites *BS Yeddyurappa - 210 sitesWHAT IS A G CATEGORY SITE The chief minister has the discretionary powers to allot BDA sites to persons in public life under G-category. Of the available land, 30% will be distributed under G-category. On May 26, 2011, the Karnataka high court quashed the powers of the chief minister to allot sites under G-category.
BANGALORE: The state government on Tuesday effected postings of several IPS officers. Amar Kumar Pandey has been posted as ADGP (Directorate of Civil Right Enforcement), P Ravindranath ADGP (Karnataka State Reserve Police), Sanjay Sahay ADGP (police computer wing), T Suneel Kumar ADGP (internal security division), Sunil Agarwal IGP (Exercise Enforcement), Prashant Kumar Thakur IGP (State Human Rights Commission), Syed Ulfath Hussein IGP Central Range, Vijay Kumar Singh IGP administration, chief office (state), P Harishekaran additional commissioner of police (admin Bangalore city), K V Sharathchandra, joint commissioner of police (law and order), Bangalore East, B A Padmanayana DIG (Intelligence), D Roopa DIG, CID (economic offences), and N Shivaprasad DIG (security).
BANGALORE: The negligence of joint commissioners of Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike in its six zones has resulted in the civic body suffering a loss of Rs 4,500 crore in property tax , Yediyur councilor NR Ramesh alleged at a BBMP council meeting here on Tuesday. Ramesh said there are more than 8,000 paying guest hostels, 53 tech parks, 107 malls and multiplexes, 2091 marriage and party halls, 441 star hotels, 2,450 lodges and 2,446 super specialty hospitals, about 1.10 lakh industrial buildings and around 22,000 apartments in BBMP limits. But tax mobilization from these properties is very poor and joint commissioners are responsible for this, he alleged. Ramesh said there are 30 buildings each of which have dues of Rs 5 crore, 60 buildings with Rs 3 crore each due, and 125 buildings with Rs two crore due each and 400 buildings with Rs one crore due each. There are about 1,300 buildings, each of which have to pay more than Rs 50 lakh, he claimed. Ramesh said the BBMP administration is not recruiting Karnataka Administrative Services officers as joint commissioners due to which the revenue generation has been badly hit. As per the rules of Karnataka Municipal Corporation (KMC) only KAS officers can be appointed as joint commissioners, but the BBMP has never taken up this matter with the state government. Later BBMP commissioner M Lakshminarayana said he would direct all the joint commissioners to review the information provided by Ramesh before the next Council meeting. Due to lack of man power the Palike had taken officers from other departments as joint commissioners, he added.
 The symbolism is enormous. The governor himself will step into Nabanna and, along with chief minister Mamata Banerjee, will introduce an âadministrative calendarâ, which is an effort to map work flow from allocation to completion. IIM-Kolkataâs professor of economics, Anindya Sen, clarifies some doubts. In an administrative set-up, which involves several departments working for a common goal, how feasible will be a administrative calendar? It can be feasible provided there is careful planning for identifying responsibilities of departments, scheduling of the workflow keeping in mind these responsibilities and monitoring are done by a high-level committee. Will an administrative calendar alone help tide over the tardy service-delivery mechanism in government set-ups? The calendar can be a useful first step to raise awareness about the need for timely completion of various projects and the need to attend to individual files in a time-bound manner. Do you envisage any immediate benefits? If the government officials take this seriously, then the present culture of non-accountability and corruption may start to change. However, I am afraid that there are too many individuals who have enormous stakes in the current system of non-transparency, rigidity and non-accountability, and they will try to sabotage the system from within. So we may not see visible benefits immediately, but there definitely will be an impact over time. It has been said making such a work flow denominator workable isnât only about administrative completion but also updation of records in a time-bound manner. Moreover, in absence of any escalation matrix, such delays can make the entire exercise futile. Your views. The updation of records can be easily made an integral part of the administrative calendar. In fact, proper implementation of the administrative calendar will require such updation on a regular basis. Do you believe this has the ingredients to usher in a new work culture? I believe this is a welcome first step. But it has to be supplemented with a system of recruitment and training, which will over time induct new and dynamic people in government offices. The benefits from new systems can be fully realized only when the workers in question have a receptive and positive attitude to new systems and I believe the younger generation of inductees will have such attitudes. Your views on the recent act passed in West Bengal which envisages action against officers for inaction. Any attempt to introduce âsticksâ rather than âcarrotsâ in government offices always have to guard against the possibility of victimisation of honest and sincere officials. But I am sure that chronic malingerers can be identified and if some action can be taken against them, the system will surely show an improvement. 
BANGALORE: AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi's diktat to Congress ruled states to incorporate provisions of Lokpal bill may not be applicable in case of Karnataka. The Karnataka Lokayukta Act 1984 is strong enough to tackle many issues pertaining to corruption. Former Lokayukta Justice Santosh N Hegde maintained that barring a few procedural hitches, the anti-graft watchdog in Karnataka is governed by a strong law. "Our act is in no way inferior to the Lokpal bill. However, the government needs to address some procedural issues. When I was the Lokayukta, a letter was sent to the government seeking certain powers. Those are yet to be accorded," he told TOI. Recommendations from the Lokayukta included government sanction for prosecution. Justice Hegde said in case such a sanction wasn't possible, the watchdog had sought for reasons for the same. "The government remains silent when the Lokayukta asks for sanction to prosecute officials. If it's not interested, it should at least give reasons," Justice Hegde said. Law and parliamentary affairs minister T B Jayachandra said he was yet to look into the details of the Lokpal bill. "We wouldn't hesitate to incorporate the provisions of Lokpal bill. But before that the government needs to study the bill in detail," he said.Highlights of the Lokpal bill * Lokpal to receive complaints against ministers, MPs and all government servants. Similar provision relating to Lokayuktas * Lokpal to function as final appellate authority for grievances relating to delivery of public services * Complaints against chairperson and members to be sent to the President, who can remove them after obtaining the Supreme Court's opinion * PM and all categories of government servants included within Lokpal's ambit * Complaint of corruption against PM will be subject to in-camera preliminary inquiry by a full bench of Lokpal, comprising not less than 75% of its members * Lokpal to have independent inquiry and prosecution wing * All NGOs receiving more than Rs 10 lakh donation per annum from foreign sources will come within the Lokpal's purviewKarnataka Lokayukta Act Public servants who are covered under the Act include: chief minister, all other ministers and members of the state legislature, all officers of the state government, chairman, vice-chairman of local authorities, statutory bodies or corporations established by or under any law of the state legislature, including co-operative societies, persons in the service of local authorities, corporations owned or controlled by the state government.
NEW DELHI: In what seemed to be a fitting finale to a tumultuous year, which has seen UPA-2 battle an increasingly adverse political scenario, the ruling coalition spent the last day of 2013 fighting off speculation that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh might announce his resignation at a press conference here on Friday. "The Prime Minister will complete his tenure," the PMO asserted. Looking to squash a speculative media report about the PM mulling his resignation, information & broadcasting minister Manish Tewari said, "This report is completely baseless, based on conjecture and insinuation. I don't even think it should be dignified with a response." In fact, in his New Year's eve message on Tuesday, Singh himself dropped no hint of any exit plan, saying 2014 was a time of hope and an opportunity to make a new beginning with fresh resolve and confidence to fulfill incomplete goals. He said the New Year is an occasion to evaluate "successes and achievements as well as lapses and shortcomings. It provides an opportunity to reassess ourselves and to plan for the year ahead, taking corrective action and setting new goals." Sources said that while Singh could clarify that he is not up for a third term when he addresses a press conference on Friday, there was no indication that that he would resign or that this could as a precursor to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi being formally named the party's prime ministerial candidate. Speculation on Singh stepping down to "make way" for Rahul has been repeatedly denied. However, it continues to simmer because of in-house activism for party vice-president's projection as PM candidate as well as the unsettled politics in the wake of a slump in Congress's fortunes over issues ranging from poll reverses, high inflation and corruption. Although Rahul has taken charge of the party and the forthcoming January 17 session might see a chorus for him to be anointed the PM candidate, there are no signs yet to suggest about any plan to declare him party's choice for the top job. Party chief Sonia Gandhi's statement in the immediate wake of the December 8 debacle that the party would declare its PM candidate at the 'opportune moment" did not resolve the conundrum about whether the crucial announcement might come before the polls. The I&B minister said Rahul was the "natural" leader of the Congress, but carefully maintained that he could not elaborate on Sonia's recent remarks that a decision will taken on a prime ministerial nominee at an appropriate time. Reacting sharply to media reports, Tewari said, "Media keep cribbing, that he (prime minister) doesn't talk to media, now that the prime minister has consented to talk to the press in the beginning of 2014, to even speculate in the manner in which it is being done, I think is in poor taste," he said. PMO has scheduled a press conference for January 3 as first reported by TOI. Asked when Congress could announce Rahul Gandhi as its prime ministerial candidate, Tewari said: "I can only refer you back to the statement of Congress president (Sonia Gandhi), an appropriate decision would be taken at an appropriate time and will be brought to your notice." Pressed further, he said, "Rahul Gandhi is the natural leader of the Congress." At the same time, he reiterated Congress's standard formulation, referring to the `trinity' of Singh, Sonia and Rahul. Tewari's remarks came a day after senior Congress leader and finance minister P Chidambaram said the party should declare its prime ministerial candidate. 
BANGALORE: For the first time, the directorate of minorities will sponsor coaching for candidates from minority communities aspiring for the constabulary and Group C posts in the police department. Aimed at preparing minority candidates to be on par with those from other sections of society, the directorate has invited expression of interest (EOI) from coaching centres across the state on imparting training to people applying for clerical (Group C) posts and the constabulary. "The students/candidates will be shortlisted and sponsored by the directorate of minorities after following the procedure laid down by the government of Karnataka," an official from the directorate said. He said the institutions willing to provide such coaching must have a minimum of three years experience in imparting training to C grade candidates in the police department and other state government jobs. "While we have a list of institutions that are known, the procedure of selection has to be followed and institutions have time till December 30 to send in their EOI," he said. Another official conceded that the initial deadline was December 16 but the directorate extended it as the response was not good enough. Among other requirements, the institutions are required to furnish details of the proposed study material, hostel facilities, et al. They will also be required to make arrangements for training facilities for field/physical training, if they don't already have them. "It is also a must that such institutions have at least one retired police officer to coach the candidate along with a trained teacher," the official said. He added that the directorate has already begun the process of identifying candidates as per procedures laid down by the state government.
BANGALORE: The train ticket examiner of the ill-fated AC coach B 1 of Bangalore-Nanded Express BN Mohan on Tuesday recorded his statement before the commissioner of railway safety (CRS) on Tuesday. South-western railway officials said Mohan appeared before the CRS at Puttaparthi, near Kothacheruvu where the coach went up in flames. Divisional railway manager AK Agarwal said the TTE in his statement has claimed to have heard a sound at the other end of the coach towards berth 64 and rushed that side only to see a lot of smoke. Mohan claimed to have alerted and woken up several passengers and facilitated their exit from the burning coach. Agarwal denied speculation that Mohan gave away his berth to some other passenger and said that his briefcase was also fully burnt. The official declined to elaborate. However, the TTE's statement appears to be baffling as he was allotted berth No 7 on which side of the coach most of the casualties had occurred. Besides, almost every passenger at the far end of the coach survived the blaze unscathed. CRS of the south western railway zone S K Mittal started his investigation on Tuesday. The enquiry was ordered by railway minister Mallikarjun Kharge. "My investigation of the spot will be done in two days. I will get back and further examine witnesses," Mittal told TOI. However, he declined to divulge findings of the first day.
BANGALORE: Bodies of all 26 victims of Saturday's Bangalore-Nanded Express fire accident have been handed over to their relatives. On Tuesday, 12 bodies which had been kept in the Victoria Hospital mortuary pending DNA test reports were handed over to the bereaved family members. "Eighteen of the 26 bodies were subjected to the DNA test, while six were handed over after family members identified them," sources from Victoria Hospital told TOI. "We have taken an undertaking from the families that they have identified the body with the help of DNA analysis. Earlier, we had asked the families of six of the dead to bury the bodies as they had taken them before the DNA test results were out. Now the families can go ahead with their rituals and cremate them if they want to," hospital sources said. The 12 bodies that were collected by the relatives on Tuesday were of 61-year-old twin sisters Padmini Bai from Kengeri and Lalitha Bai from RR Nagar; N Rahul (28) of Gurmitkal; Ibrahim (31), Dr Asra (29) and their three-year-old son Mohammed from Raichur; Srinivas (28) and his wife Latha (26); Balbir Kaur (62) and her niece Preethi Kaur (24), both from Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore; and Eshwar Nagare (70) and his wife Kavitha (61) from Aurangabad. Carnatic singers and veena artistes Padmini and Lalitha were heading to Raichur for a recital at the time of the accident. Padmini's husband Prof (retd) H L Narahari Rao of Bangalore University who was accompanying the sisters managed to survive but suffered burns in the process. Ibrahim, Asra and their son Mohammed were returning to their home town Raichur after visiting Asra's sister in Bangalore. All the three bodies were charred beyond recognition as it was with Aurangabad couple Eshwar and Kavitha. Their 10-year-old grandson Jui's body was identified and handed over to the boy's father on Monday. The mothers of newly-wed techies, Srinivas and Latha, were inconsolable as their three-day wait in front of the mortuary ended with the bodies of the couple being handed over to them.
 KOLKATA: Itâs more than an administrative calendar; it is a step to make government departments accountable under the West Bengal Right to Public Service Act, 2013. Under the act, a citizen can track the progress of government projects and question delays or lapses.  It is not without reason that West Bengal governor M K Narayanan will step in at Nabanna for the first time to inaugurate the calendar on Thursday. The purpose is to convey the message that the government is serious about delivery of public services.  Chief minister Mamata Banerjee walked the extra mile on this count, taking it a step forward from her predecessor Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had set up a public grievance cell in 2001 and designated a particular day in the week when department secretaries were asked to sort out public complaints. Taking a leaf out of the corporate book, Mamata opted for more transparency, and also fixed deadlines for specific services, holding departments accountable under the law.  The plan can work wonders if it goes well. According to state officials, publishing an administrative calendar is only a step towards transparency. The finance department has already started issuing online circulars asking departments to draw funds under specific heads â plan or non-plan â based on which the department does a scrutiny of fund utilization by departments from time to time. Now the departments have to prepare the database for the ongoing projects and upload their progress so that they can be compared with the announced deadlines published in the academic calendar. To begin with, departments have submitted a status report on the ongoing projects to the chief secretary.  The updating has to be regular and nodal department monitoring projects involving more than one department has to take extra initiative to make the calendar functional. Chief secretary Sanjay Mitra was busy overseeing the departmental reports on Tuesday.  The calendar proposes to come out of the archaic British file-tracking system, in which officials could track the movement of files at various levels of the administration. The new system envisages total e-connectivity among departments and updating information online. The calendar will also pinpoint the bottlenecks in the progress of projects. Some departments had reported in the meeting that some files are held up in the finance department or while awaiting clearance from the land department.  The elevated road between Jinjira Bazar and Batanagar, water supply project for Bhadreswar Municipality, storm water drainage for Baruipur, Rishra and South Dum Dum municipalities are some of the civic projects in the pipeline. 
NEW DELHI: Ringing out a year that ended with an unqualified diplomatic disaster in what used to be an almost enviable bilateral relationship, US ambassador to India Nancy Powell used a New Year message to express regrets for "the circumstances" of the arrest of diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York on December 12. Wishing Indians a happy new year, Powell said, she joins "Secretary Kerry in expressing our regret for the circumstances of the consular officer's arrest, but we believe that we can look forward to continuing to expand our bilateral relations." However, she was careful to confine her regret to the circumstances of the arrest, not the arrest itself. She did not acknowledge the diplomat's immunity either, which India found recently had been in force since August 26 and certainly covering the time of her arrest. With the US State Department having signed off for the holidays, there is little movement on the issue. Sources in charge of resolving the impasse believe both sides can come to an understanding that would be mutually acceptable. But officially the statements remain inflexible which points to a prolonged stalemate. In New York, US attorney Preet Bharara, special prosecutor in this case, briefed journalists off the record, promising to continue with the case against Khobragade. Scoffing at the media coverage in India, Bharara said he would carry through the case against Khobragade paying less than fair wages to her maid. The US State Department is yet to formally accept the UN accreditation for Khobragade, even though they got the Indian diplomat's papers almost a week ago. Officials explained this was because everybody was away on holiday. In New Delhi, the MEA has curtailed many activities of US diplomats, and plan to stop quasi-commercial activities started by the US Embassy in its premises. Talking about since she arrived here as the American ambassador, Powell said, "during the subsequent months, the US Mission has been engaged in not only looking forward but in joining our Indian partners in moving forward". Reminding Indians of the value of the bilateral relationship, she added, "We have neared the $100 billion mark in two-way trade in goods and services; police chiefs from both of our countries sat together to share their experiences and to look to greater cooperation; we have had deep and fruitful consultations at the highest levels on resolving some of the world's crises; and via your Mars Orbiter Mission, whose launch I was privileged to watch, we boosted our relationship to a whole new world." 
KOLKATA: A year after the Nirbhaya horror, yet another gang-rape victim lost her battle for life at the state-run R G Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata on New Yearâs Eve. The 16-year-old, a resident of Madhyamgram in North 24-Parganas, was gang-raped at Badu on Oct-ober 25. The next day, while on her way back home from the police station after lodging a complaint, she was allegedly sexually abused all over again. The teenager and her family were so traumatized by the sequence of events that they chose to shift to another tenement close to Kolkata Airport. But there was no respite. The miscreants continued to hound her till she finally poured kerosene on herself on December 23 and lit a match. She was admitted to the hospital with 40% burns and finally succumbed on Tuesday afternoon. Political parties, trade unionists and social workers converged on the hospital as soon as news of the teenagerâs death spread. The girlâs parents were inconsolable. Their only child had dreamt of being a teacher. The mother claimed that her daughter didnât commit suicide but was murdered by the two men who used to hound them. According to her, the victim had clearly mentioned this in the statement she made to the police a couple of days after being admitted to hospital. The police admitted that she had made a statement but said she hadnât accused anybody. Eight persons have been arrested. Six of them are accused of gang rape while the remaining allegedly drove her to suicide, the police maintain. âMy daughter felt insecure and intimidated living in the Madhyamgram locality where the families of the six accused also lived. Living close to the spot where she underwent the ordeal only added to her trauma. We shifted to the new place to help ease her suffering,â the girlâs mother, who has been camping at the hospital since December 23, said. The parents had hoped that their daughter would manage to pull through but sepsis and respiratory distress prevailed. The girl was also pregnant and was suffering from infection either due to an abortion, either induced or spontaneous, doctors at the hospital said. On the evening of October 25, the teenager was waylaid and held captive inside a farm, barely a km from her home in Madhyamgram. Six of the accused took turns in raping her. The next morning, she returned home battered and bruised. After her father, a taxi driver, returned from work, she went to the police station to lodge a complaint. On her way back, she was allegedly dragged away by the six and gang-raped all over again. The girlâs father hails from Bihar and brought his family to Kolkata barely five months before the incident. The reason for the familyâs coming to Kolkata was the girlâs desire to study in a school in Kolkata. The family wanted to get her admitted to Class-VIII in a government school. âShe was extremely determined. Even after suffering the trauma, she wanted to get admitted to school. We sent her for private tuitions to prepare her for the admission procedure. She wanted to be teacher and pull the family out from poverty. Now all dreams have shattered,â the mother added. What actually happened on December 23? The family had shifted to the single-room tenement near the airport gate about six months earlier. For obvious reasons, they hadnât told landlord Ratan Sil of what the teenager had undergone. Unfortunately, Silâs wife had a nephew who lived in the neighbourhood where the girl had been raped. Within days, this youth named Minta turned up at his auntâs house and started hounding the girl and her family. He was joined in by Sil. âI suspect that they wanted to take advantage of the situation and sexually harass my daughter again. One day while returning home, I found Minta knocking on the front door. When I asked what he wanted, he made a lame excuse. Around 9 am on December 23, he and Sil came over and started abusing us. My husband had gone to Krishnanagar with a fare. I left my daughter alone and went to the main road to see if any of his friends were around. On returning, I found the door bolted from the outside and smoke billowing from the window. I rushed in to find her in flames. She called out to me and said that I should also join her as the goons wouldnât leave me in peace either. I called out to neighbours and they doused the blaze. I suspect that Minta and Sil set my daughter ablaze,â the mother said. âMy daughter would often tell me: Papa mujhe nyay chahiye (Dad I want justice). She was going through hell. She was depressed but she wanted to live and start a new life and see her rapists convicted. My daughter was not the one to take her own life,â her father said. The kin alleged that the police and the administration did not ensure security and rehabilitation to the girl. They also alleged medical negligence by the hospital. They claimed that girl was kept in the emergency ward for the first three days and only shifted her to the surgical ward later. They also wanted to shift the girl to the SSKM where there is a burn unit but the hospital allegedly refused to refer her there. âThe girlâs condition was very critical and hence we could not refer her to SSKM. We told the family to shift her on a risk bond which they did not. Despite a medical board monitoring her she succumbed to her injuries,â said Dr S Batabyal, principal, R G Kar Hospital.
KOLKATA: No more warnings or taking away of answer scripts. Students caught copying in board examinations or even helping in the act may have to cool their heels behind bars. Announcing the governmentâs zero-tolerance approach, education minister Bratya Basu said: âWe didnât explore the arrest option. We have been forced to act tough to put an end to the menace.â As part of the crackdown plan, the government has decided to instal closed-circuit television sets at vulnerable examination centres across the state. This will help in identifying offenders. âI have asked the Madhyamik Board authorities and also the Higher Secondary Council to draw up a list of vulnerable examination centres that will be handed over to the director general of police,â Basu said. Many schools in the three districts of Malda, South Dinajpur and North Dinajpur complained of mass copying last year. Some schools were vandalised following clashes between students and police officials. The chief secretary and DGP will hold a meeting with the board authorities at Nabanna on January 6 to draw up a comprehensive plan. âThe malpractice was overlooked during the Left Front regime and had turned into a menace till we made a sincere effort to curb it since last year. Video cameras will be installed in examination centres this time. Anyone found copying or helping in mass copying may be put behind bars,â Basu said. Welcoming the move to put exam cheaters behind bars, West Bengal Higher Secondary Council president Mahua Das said: âAt some centres, the examinees found copying used to create a ruckus. The video footage will come of great use in identifying the vandals now.â
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court in 2013 continued with trend that started 35 years ago and strove for electoral reforms by ordering disqualification of elected representatives on their conviction in serious offences while empowering voters to cast a negative vote to say none in the fray deserved h/his precious vote. Judicial decisions ushering in electoral reforms started in 1978, when the SC interpreted Article 324 of the Constitution to empower the Election Commission (EC) with unbridled powers in conducting and supervising elections. In Mohinder Singh Gill case, it had said: "The Constitution contemplates free and fair election and vests comprehensive responsibilities of superintendence, direction and control of the conduct of elections in the EC. This responsibility may cover powers, duties and functions of many sorts, administrative or other, depending on the circumstances." For 20 years thereafter, there was a lull. In 1996, the court in the Common Cause case had ordered the political parties to submit details of expenses it incurred for each candidate and otherwise in an election. In 2002, the apex court in Association for Democratic Reforms judgment returned its focus on the little man in the voter who alone slapped accountability on the political system in a democracy. In both the 1978 and the 2002 judgments, the SC had quoted British premier Winston Churchill, who had said: "At the bottom of all the tributes paid to democracy is the little man, walking into a little booth, with a little pencil, making a little cross on a little bit of paper â no amount of rhetoric or voluminous discussion can possibly diminish the overwhelming importance of the point." In 2002, the court ruled that voters' right to information was fundamental. To enable a voter make an informed choice, the court ordered every candidate to submit an affidavit with nomination papers giving correct information about h/his educational qualification, details of h/his and family assets, and importantly, h/his criminal background. Ingenious politicians found a way around this judgment. They left blank columns which demanded information which were uncomfortable. The SC in 2013 put an end to this practice. A bench headed by Chief Justice P Sathasivam ruled that if a candidate left columns blank, then the returning officer could reject the nomination papers. This years' most important judgment on electoral reforms came from a bench headed by Justice A K Patnaik. It ruled that an MP or MLA would be disqualified immediately after being convicted in a serious offence and sentenced to two or more years in prison. Earlier, the MPs and MLAs could continue to hold on to their seats in Parliament or the assembly by merely filing an appeal against the order of conviction and sentence. Two more judgments on electoral reforms flowed from the CJI-headed bench. One allowed a voter to cast a negative vote 'none of the above' (NOTA) to tell political parties that candidates fielded by them were not worthy of his vote. In the second judgment, it asked the EC to provide receipt of vote cast through EVMs to tell the world that we are electronic, transparent and honest when it comes to voting. What we could expect in 2014 is a judgment from the SC whether 'paid news' formed part of poll expense, could the EC examine poll expenses and disqualify those who exceeded the limit. Petitioners in this case include former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan and former Jharkhand CM Madhu Koda. 
 MUMBAI: A doctor from the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital, pursuing his post-graduation in preventive social medicine, died of dengue on Tuesday. During his treatment at, Sumedh Pazare (25) was also found to be suffering from sickle cell anaemia, a genetic disorder endemic to Chandrapur, his hometown.  Pazare, posted at a health centre in Cheetah camp, Govandi, became the second doctor of a civic hospital to die this year of an ailment, contracted at work. The BMC is yet to include his death in the official toll that has gone up from from five in 2012 to 11 this year.  The resident doctorâs primary duty at the urban health centre in Cheetah camp, Govandi, ironically was to diagnose ailments such as dengue and malaria, and refer patients to a tertiary centre for advanced care. Aedes egypti mosquito, which transmits dengue, is known to be a day biter.  City physicians are unanimous that the actual count of both dengue cases and deaths would be much higher. This year there were 927 cases compared to 2012âs 1,008.  Pazare was admitted to the hospital on Saturday though he had symptoms such as fever since the previous Thursday. By this time, he had started bleeding from his gums. Soon, his platelet count plummeted to a critically low range of 19,000 (normal 1.5-4 lakh per microlitre). He was given four transfusions but he succumbed before completing the fifth one.  Senior doctors at the hospital were certain that his sickle cell anaemia disease had a role to play in the quick progression of dengue. The hospital had no prior knowledge of the disorder and suspect that Pazare was also unaware of the disorder he was born with.  Dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal said, âThe sickle cell disease made it difficult to stop internal bleeding. Multiple CT scans performed on Pazare showed signs of infarction (tissue death caused by lack of oxygen). He was very critical at the end and had to be put on ventilator.â  Pazare used to stay in the doctorsâ quarters in Girgaum where a thorough check for breeding spots will be carried out. The hospital did not have any other medical students suffering from dengue, Bharmal claimed. This was also the second death of a medical staffer from Nair Hospital, the first one being that of a nurse who died of tuberculosis in June. Pazare body will be taken to his hometown on Wednesday.  Though dengue remained a nagging worry throughout the year, it was malaria that retained its position of being the top killer, claiming 25 lives and affecting nearly 10,000 people. H1N1 remained under control taking one life and affecting 77 people. 
 MUMBAI: The state government has increased the ready reckoner (RR) rates for residential and commercial properties by up to 20% in municipal corporation areas of Pune, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai from the new year.  RR rates have been increased by over 20% in only 26 zones of the total 737 zones into which Mumbai is divided. The increase in rates mostly affects select tony areas like Worli, Napeansea Road, Altamount Road and Carter Road. In 2012, the government had increased RR rates by a maximum 30%.  RR is an annual statement of propert rates based on which the stamps and registration department collects stamp duty from property buyers. The government intends to garner over Rs 20,000 crore in 2013-14.  Tax collection through stamps and registration is the highest source of revenue for the state.  The real estate sector and the ruling and opposition parties had strongly opposed any rise in ready reckoner rates due to the current economic slowdown and deteriorating financial condition of the sector. Property buyers would have to shell out more, as based on the revised RR rates, they would also have to pay higher value added tax, service tax and stamp duty.  Senior town planning officials said the hike in RR is not much compared to the property rates in the open market and contrary to the perception that the economic slump had slowed down property transactions. âMumbai in fact, saw an increase in the registration of property documents. Over 2.07 lakh property documents were registered from January to November 2013 against 1.98 lakh documents for the same period in 2012. The reason for the hike in registration numbers could be the recent new change in income tax rules of valuing property as per RR rates. Consumers may have seen a benefit in registering their property,ââ said an official.  Amin Patel, Congress legislator from south Mumbai, said, âI had written a letter to chief minister Prithviraj Chavan requesting that the government not hike RR rates in the current prevailing economic condition as it will ultimately have a negative impact on property buyers. I had hoped the government would change its mind.ââ 
 MUMBAI: Contractors have yet again bid abysmally lowâ52% below the BMCâs base priceâfor tenders to level roads dug by underground utility owners. Civic officials said that such low bidding will affect quality of work.  According to BMC data, all the seven contractors, one for each zone, have bid lesser than the BMCâs asking rate. They have quoted 45.74% to 52.12% below the base price. The BMC has set aside Rs 20 crore for the work i each zone. It had earlier planned to ask utility owners to reinstate roads after completing their work. But last monsoon, the BMC had a tough time getting them to restore the roads. Hence, it has decided to appoint contractors to fill the trenches and reinstate roads. The proposal will be tabled for approval at the civic standing committee on Friday. 
DOHA: Wimbledon champion Andy Murray gave the Qatar Exxonmobil Open an Usain Bolt-like start on new year's eve, powering past the clueless local teen Mousa Shanan Zayed in 37-minutes, for the loss of just 17 points. The score was a tasteless double bagel. The opening round contest had little to do with the 19-year-old student-pro, ranked outside the game's top-1000 and who is yet to win a match on the ATP Tour, as eye-balls and cameras strained in the direction of the two-time Grand Slam champion, playing his first competitive match in nearly four months. Murray didn't need to stretch himself, especially on his serve, using placement over power. Playing from well within the baseline and controlling the points against an opponent, who didn't quite know what to do with his serves and strokes, the British No.1 moved into the second round, where he takes on German Florian Mayer. Murray, who headed straight to the practice court on the completion match, didn't mince words, calling the opening round clash, easy. The Scot, who had a 100 per cent record on his first serve on the day, said it wasn't all that common for a match, though it had happened to him in the past, especially in a set. "It's a tough situation," Murray said of the match, saying it wasn't easy for his opponent, "but you just have to concentrate and do the best you can. I didn't feel sorry for him during the match, maybe afterwards, but not when we were playing."
 NEW DELHI: Cold wave continued to disrupt life across north India as fresh snowfall in Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh further plunged the mercury on Tuesday.  The Valley was cut off following heavy snowfall that lead to the closure of the Srinagar-Jammu national highway and cancelation of flights. The Banihal-Qazigund-Baramulla train service was suspended. As a precautionary measure, power supply was cut off in many parts of the Valley.  Four people were trapped under an avalanche at Gund in Qazigund. Kashmir divisional commissioner Shailendra Kumar said two people were rescued and efforts were on to trace others.  The higher reaches of Himachal experienced another spell of snow while the middle and lower hills witnessed widespread rainfall. Icy winds accompanied by rainfall and snow lashed upper regions of Shimla with the Hindustan-Tibet National Highway blocked beyond Matiana due to the snowfall.  Thousands of tourists have landed in Shimla and other key tourist resorts to ring in 2014 with the forecast for heavy snowfall having raised the hopes for a 'White New Yearâ.  In Uttar Pradesh, overcast sky and rain lead to drop in maximum temperatures. The worst hit were thousands of riot victims living in relief camps of Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts. Though some families were moved into government buildings, many had to spend night in open. Survivors complained that they couldnât even light bonfires due to the wet weather. The minimum temperature in Muzaffarnagar rose from 0.3 to 7.8 in comparison to Monday but maximum temperature was at 15.8, a drop of five degrees.  The state Met department has predicted clear sky in the next 24-48 hours followed by thick fog and drop in night temperatures.  In Rajasthan, early morning fog disrupted road, rail and air traffic across the state. The traffic on Jaipur-Agra and Delhi-Jaipur highways remained chaotic.  Mount Abu in the hills and Jaisalmer in plains remained coldest, with minimum temperatures of minus 0.5 and 1.7. Due to the western disturbances the Met office said mild to moderate showers may occur at some parts in the eastern Rajasthan in the next 24 hours.  In Punjab and Haryana, night temperatures dropped considerably with Adampur shivering at minus 2.4 and Narnaul at minus 0.5. A Met department official said the two states, along with Chandigarh, are brazing for dense fog in the coming days.  Shivpuri was the coldest place in Madhya Pradesh at 5 degrees. The state met office said cloudy conditions may persist for next 48 hours. 
MADURAI: Karupayurani police arrested two people on Tuesday in connection with the unsuccessful attempt to burgle an ATM kiosk here on Monday. The youth, whose image was caught by the CCTV cameras at the kiosk, surrendered at the judicial magistrate court on Tuesday noon. Weapons used to break the ATM and the vehicle used by the gang have been seized, police said. The accused have been identified as Tamil Arasan (19), Saravanapandi (22), and Muthuvelu (22). Arasan and Saravanapandi were arrested during a vehicle check near Andarkottaram junction on the ring road near Karupayurani. Muthuvelu surrendered in the court. His image was captured by the CCTV cameras while he was damaging them using a hammer. CCTV cameras have also been seized from them, said the police. We received information on their movement on the ring road and trapped them. On investigation it was revealed they had been watching over the ATM from 10pm until they entered the centre in the early hours on Monday, T Balamurugan, Karupayurani police inspector, said.
MADURAI: Two railway employees have been sentenced to two years imprisonment by the CBI's special court here on Tuesday on charges of taking bribe. A fine of Rs 20,000 each has also been imposed on them. The convicted are Jayasekar (50) and Jayaraman (47). The prosecution case was that the two demanded Rs 13,000 bribe from one Dhanasekaran who had applied for job in railways under compassionate ground after the death of his brother Pakkirisamy who worked in southern railway's Trichy office. They had asked for bribe for sending documents to the concerned railway department. Dhanasekaran, who was unwilling to pay the bribe, raised the matter with CBI's anti-corruption wing. Based on its advice, he gave Rs 13,000 to the duo on January 6, 2010. They two were caught red-handed while they were receiving the bribe. The case was heard at the CBI special court in Madurai. Judge M M Krishnan passed order in the case after the prosecution proved the charge against the accused, said N Nagendran, CBI public prosecutor.
TUTICORIN: The voluminous 2,158-page chargesheet filed by the state Q branch in the case of maritime violations by the US-based vessel MV Seaman Guard Ohio has named the shipping company's president William Watson, besides crew members, for violations of the Indian Arms Act by sending the arms-laden ship into Indian territorial waters. The chargesheet includes information gathered from the ship crew on their alleged intrusion into Indian territorial waters. The ballistic lab report on the arms seized from the ship as well as the cyber lab report that details its GPS position in Indian waters when it was detained has also been included in the chargesheet, sources said. The vessel, on an anti-piracy assignment, was detained on October 12 for straying into Indian waters, carrying a huge cache of arms and ammunition, apparently meant to be used to resist piracy attacks. Such floating armouries strike mid-sea deals with vessels to provide them protection in piracy-infested areas. The Judicial Magistrate court in Tuticorin is likely to hold a hearing on the chargesheet on January 3. Sources said the chargesheet has to be handed over to the accused in the case on that day. There are possibilities that the crew members, who were arrested and lodged in prisons in Puzhal in Chennai and Palayamkottai in Tirunelveli will either be produced in court or briefed through video-conferencing. Besides, their remand period expires the same day. The court will decide the further course of action in the case, officials said. The Seaman Guard Ohio was detained by the Indian Coast Guard with 35 crew members, including 25 anti-piracy guards aboard. The Q branch took over the case and the ship crew was arrested and lodged in the prison. The bail pleas of the crew members were rejected by the Tuticorin court and Madurai Bench of the Madras high court. But the magistrate court granted them conditional bail on a fresh petition filed by them on December 26 on the grounds that the chargesheet was not filed within 60 days. However, the Q branch filed a review petition before the Principal Sessions Court on December 28 seeking a stay on the bail. The court stayed the bail and the Q branch filed the chargesheet before the judicial magistrate court on Monday evening.
MADURAI: The spurt in violence against women has stirred not just the government and police to take steps to fight the evil. A 28-year-old from Andhra Pradesh has decided to raise voice against attack on women and make the country heard by venturing out on a walk from near Kanyakumari to Kashmir. The extreme cross-country walker is Bharat Kumar Jallur, a resident of Govada village in Guntur district. A sales manager by profession, Bharat wants to be a change-agent through his mission to create awareness against violence against women. Starting the walk at Nagercoil near Kanyakumari, he reached Madurai on Tuesday on the 12th day of his five-month walkathon that will cover about 3,500 km. All along the way he managed to get permission from eight colleges to interact with the students and send out the strong message that women are not weak. "Men should not see women as sex toys," he said while calling for an end to violence against women. Nagercoil sub-collector Shankar Lal Kumawat helped him obtain permission from the institutions. Bharat was spotted on busy Madurai city roads, holding a banner reading 'Stop Violence Against Women'. Occasionally, pedestrians enquired about his mission and trip. He walks around 30 to 50 km daily, carrying bags weighing more than 10 kg. The BSc graduate is sensitive about the treatment meted out to women. His mother, Nagarajakumari, was deserted by his father when he was only three months. "Growing up, I closely witnessed how a women without a man's support is harassed by the society. She was fed up with the society. When I was in college she fell ill. She did not reveal her health problem and consoled me saying it was only a viral fever. She was actually suffering from typhoid and died subsequently," Bharat narrated. While working as a medical representative in the beginning of his career, Bharat also witnessed how women are sexually harassed by the male-dominant society. "The way men see women is completely wrong which leads to several distress for women. Men suffer if something happened to women in their family, but they do not realise the same when they harass other women. Something should be done in the way children are brought up," he said. His friends in Guntur --- Y Chandrasekar, Y Rajesh, P Srikanth and P Sasi -- have made his endeavour possible by giving him both moral and financial support.
 BHOPAL: The chief operating officer (COO) of Shri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences (SAIMS), Indore, GM Khanuja, was arrested from Bangalore on Monday evening by the Special Task Force (STF) of Madhya Pradesh police. Khanuja was wanted in connection with irregularities in the medical pre-PG 2012 admission scam. He was taken to Indore on Tuesday and later brought to Bhopal.  STF officials are questioning Khanuja in connection with the scam. STF sources said that Khanuja is believed to have used fraudulent means to ensure the admission of his son Abhijeet Khanuja to pre-medical entrance examinations in 2012. Abhijeet secured 12th rank in the examination.  Khanujaâs statement will also decide the fate of Vinod Bhandari, the chairman and managing director of SAIMS.  Earlier, manager of SAIMS, Pradeep Rahuvanshi, was arrested by STF in connection with the scam. It is believed that Khanujaâs arrest has come after statements given by Rahguvanshi, said STF sources. 
MADURAI: "Children and women are the worst affected when the man of the house is a drunkard. There is no better resolution than quitting alcohol as the new year dawns." This is the message a 10-year girl conveyed to the district administration here on Tuesday morning as she went on a flash hunger strike clad in her uniform and holding placards. While the city was gearing up for New Year celebrations and customary booze parties on New Year's Eve, it was curious to see the girl, M Jothimani, accompanied by her father and their neighbours assembled in front of the district collectorate early on Tuesday morning, urging public to abstain from alcohol. They demanded the state government to implement total prohibition so that many families could be saved from alcoholism.Tallakulam police who rushed to the spot had the tough task of convincing the girl to abandon her hunger strike and submit her demand as a petition to the district administration. Soon, Jothimani and her neighbours were taken to the camp office of the district collector. A resident of Munichalai in the city, Jothimani is a student of class 4. She drew inspiration to launch a bid against alcoholism after her successful attempt to wean her father R Mohanraj away from his drinking habit, a year back. Soon, she started persuading her neighbours to quit drinking and handed over pamphlets on the evils of liquor to the public. Jothimani's efforts didn't go in vain. Around 10 people were converted to her cause and were taken to alcohol de-addiction programme offered by the city corporation at Kodikulam, Mohanraj said. "I was into drinking alcohol from my young days and became an addict over the years. My entire family suffered. One year ago, Jothimani persuaded me to quit drinking for ever," he said. There began Mohanraj's efforts to avoid liquor. He had to be enrolled at the de-addiction centre as he gave in to temptation occasionally despite his determination to turn a new page in his life. "I have not consumed liquor for more than a year and most of my problems have been solved. I owe my daughter for her perseverance," the proud father said. "She feels that only total prohibition can save many families and we want to support her," said Noushad Babu, one of the neighbours who accompanied the girl. "I appeal to the public to quit alcohol from New Year's Day. Collector has received my petition and assured that it will be forwarded to the state government," Jothimani said.
 DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government on Tuesday announced Rs 5,000 as winter aid to the families rendered homeless in the catastrophe that struck Rudrapryag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts in mid-June. The state government took this decision at a meeting of top officials chaired by CM Vijay Bahuguna.  "Giving Rs 5,000 each to the victims living at school buildings or rented houses in deluge-hit areas is the need of the hour," said 66-year-old retired school teacher Yogendra Singh Bisht at Gaurikund in Rudrapryag district.  A senior IAS officer, who participated in the meeting, said this financial aid will be given apart from Rs 7,000 each as compensation already distributed. He said the victims have also been getting a monthly rent of Rs 3,000 each.  Disaster Management secretary Bhaskaranand Joshi told TOI the state government has released a total amount of Rs 13 crores for the financial assistance. Talking to reporters on Tuesday, CM Bahuguna said it was also decided to pay compensation to those running their business on rented shops.  "Our 20-member team is making an assessment of property losses in Kedarnathâs flashfloods and we will finally decide the amount to be paid to shopkeepers after receiving the report," said a senior IAS officer in Dehradun. 
GURGAON: The Congress government in Haryana announced a rebate of Rs 200 on power bills on Saturday, hours after the Aam Aadmi Party regime in Delhi slashed electricity tariffs. The state government also promised power tariffs would not be increased in the 2014-15 financial year, switching to populist mode and betraying the anxiety among the political clan about AAP turning the tide further in its favour before the Lok Sabha elections and assembly polls in Haryana. The announcements were made by chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who said his government would pay the subsidized sum to the power discoms operating in north and south Haryana. The rebate, which will be applicable only if a household's consumption in two months is less than 1,600 units, will be effective from January 1. But even though it was pitched as a New Year gift to residents of Haryana, people saw through its populist nature, looking at it as a crude attempt to outdo AAP rather than a sincere effort to reorganize the tariff structure and make power cheaper for people. "The reduction of Rs 200 means nothing to the consumer as the power tariff in Haryana is huge. Moreover, it has been announced on the same day as Arvind Kejriwal has cut power tariffs in Delhi," said Aseem Takyar, an RTI activist and resident of Sector 23 A. Other residents pointed out that the government was yet to solve complaints of "inflated" bills, an issue that Kejriwal has addressed simultaneously in Delhi by ordering an audit of power companies. "There is no way of detecting how the bills are inflated. Yes, there are fewer power cuts but the meters are racing," said Sudhir Gupta, a Sector 4 resident. Nisha Singh, the Ward No. 30 councillor elected as an Independent, said the rebate was an "election year gimmick", and that such "freebies were not sustainable". Mangat Ram Bagri, the BJP councillor of Ward No. 10, said, "Congress has done this because it is scared of AAP. This is just eyewash and there actually is no relief to the people" According to the existing tariffs, a household has to pay Rs 2.98 per unit for consuming up to 400 units a month. Households consuming more than 800 units a month pay a fixed tariff of Rs 5.98 per unit. In addition, a 21% fuel surcharge is added to the bill. "The surcharge really hurts. Residents have been protesting against it, but all the government comes up with is a Rs 200 relief. It should waive this surcharge," said Dharambir Yadav, a resident.

 DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand state police have intensified search operations for BJP legislator Rajkumar Thukral, who has been evading arrest for over three months now.  âWe have a non bailable warrant against Thukral. Our teams have intensified raids to trace him as soon as possible,â SSP, Udham Singh Nagar, Ridhim Aggrawal, said.  An MLA from Udham Singh Nagar, Thukral has been evading arrest after an NBW was issued against him in connection with the riots that took place in Rudrapur on October 2, 2011. Four people were killed and 60 injured in the communal frenzy after torn pages of a holy book were found outside a place of worship in the town.  State police on Saturday attached several properties of Thukral in Udham Singh Nagar. The move came after a court declared Thukral a âproclaimed offenderâ and issued attachment orders to be pasted at his Adarsh Colony house in Rudrapur. âAfter attaching his properties, we have also begun the process of chargesheeting Thukral,â Aggrawal added.  Thukral was declared an absconder by a local court in November this year. The order came following a petition filed by the CB-CID. 
GURGAON: The first meeting of the street vendors' committee, led by the municipal commissioner, was held on Tuesday. The committee was set up following a Supreme Court ruling directing civic agencies to identify land for street vendors. The meeting was marked by demonstrations by hawkers in front of the MCG office. The MCG had initiated a survey to enlist the number of street vendors who will need to be relocated and identify the space requirement. The findings of the survey, however, remained inconclusive. On Tuesday, officials from traffic police HUDA and street vendors' association sat in on a meeting to sort out issues pertaining to the relocation. "This was the first meeting on relocation drive. We are trying to identify places where these street vendors can set shop. Right now there is no such designated place, which leads to traffic snarls and congestion. The security is also compromised," said MCG commissioner Praveen Kumar. "We are also in the process of identifying zones where street vendors will be banned," he added. Meanwhile, vendors said they were being 'harassed' by the administration and police. "They can't render us jobless. They had promised to relocate us but now they are just removing us," said a protester. The agitation held up traffic on the road in front of the Civil Hospital for three hours.
GURGAON: All city schools will be closed for a 12-day-long winter vacation from Wednesday. According to senior officials of the education department, schools will remain shut from January 1 to January 10, and are scheduled to reopen, after an extra gap of a weekend, on January 13. "According to a circular from the director for secondary education, winter vacation officially begins from the first day of the year. All government and private schools of the district will remain shut until January 10," said Vandana Gupta, the district education officer. Plummeting temperatures in the region and an impending cold wave had already pushed a number of schools to declare early holidays this winter. Many schools shut down for the season in the last week of December, days before the temperature in the Delhi-NCR area dipped to a record low of 2.4 Â° Celsius, making it the coldest December day in 17 years. The chill on the night of New Year's Eve was unabated. Minimum temperatures in parts of Gurgaon hovered over that 5-7 degrees bracket. But the India Meteorological Department is predicting a harsher winter in the days to come. "Snowfall in the north will result in a dip in minimum temperatures," a Met official said. Last week, temperatures in Hisar and Narnaul dropped to minus 0.1 and minus 0.5 respectively.
 DUBAI: A Kuwaiti woman has filed for divorce just a week into her marriage over her husbandâs âpoorâ table manners. The woman accused her husband of failing to abide by table manners and proper eating etiquette. She said she was disgusted by the âshocking sightâ and could not stay with her husband the rest of life, the Gulf News reported.  Kuwait has witnessed several instances of divorce over unusual reasons.  In another case, a woman told her lawyer that she wanted to divorce her husband for insisting on squeezing the toothpaste tube in the middle and not the end. 
VATICAN CITY: The Vatican felt compelled on Tuesday to deny that Pope Francis had âabolished sinâ, after a well-known Italian intellectual wrote that he had effectively done so through his words and gestures.  The singular exchange began on Sunday when Eugenio Scalfari, an atheist who writes opinion pieces for the left-leaning La Repubblica newspaper, published an article titled âFrancisâ Revolution: He has abolished sinâ.  Scalfari, who had held a long and private conversation with the pope earlier this year and wrote about it several times, concluded in the complex, treatise-like article that Francis believed sin effectively no longer existed because Godâs mercy and forgiveness were âeternalâ.  Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that âthis affirmation that the pope has abolished sinâ was wrong. âThose who really follow the pope daily know how many times he has spoken about sin and our (human) condition as sinners,â Lombardi said. 
 DHAKA: A fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami leader was killed on Tuesday in Bangladesh in a clash with security forces as the opposition geared up for a non-stop nationwide blockade from the New Year to derail the January 5 elections.  Police said local Jamaat leader Abdul Jabbar was killed in a clash between the opposition activists and joint forces comprising paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and police in western Meherpur district, bordering India.  In Dhaka, BNP activists took out processions and exploded bombs in the city as it called for a nationwide protest on Tuesday. The main opposition BNP led by Khaleda Zia called for the nationwide blockade of transport after it was barred for the second consecutive day from staging âmarch for democracyâ in the capital city. 
 NEW DELHI: To promote public transport, the now khaas admi and aurat of Aam Aadmi Party have decided to travel by autos and Metro. Having travelled for his oath-taking ceremony by Metro, PWD and education minister Manish Sisodia chose this mode of travel again when he had to attend a school function in Dwarka on Tuesday.  Sisodia boarded the train at Akshardham station around 10.15am and travelled to Dwarka Sector 11. "I travel by Metro frequently. The journey from my house to Dwarka would have taken two hours by car, but by Metro it takes just an hour. It's also an economical way of travelling. More importantly, it gives me a chance to interact with people," he said.  During the journey, Sisodia walked the length of the train, interacting with passengers. "Namaste. Sab theek (Everything alright)?" was Sisodia's query to passengers, many of whom were stunned to see him.  A woman, Nirmala, broke down when Sisodia spoke to her. She told him her son was promised a job in Malaysia for a payment of Rs 2 lakh but when he reached there, the agency made him do menial work and took away his passport. Nirmala, from Kapoorthala in Punjab, had reached Delhi on Tuesday morning to visit the agency and ask for their son's return. When she related her story to Sisodia, he asked the SDM accompanying him to direct her to officials concerned and, if required, write to the foreign affairs ministry.  "While her problem has nothing to do with Delhi government, she's in distress and it is our duty to help her," he said. Sisodia asked passengers if any of them was willing to escort her to SDM Kapashera's office. A passenger dropped his work and volunteered to accompany her and her husband.  However, the crowd, especially media, accompanying Sisodia, was a problem for commuters. "It is an excellent move for the minister to travel with the aam admi but the next time, he should not announce his travel plans and come alone instead. Cameramen are falling over each other and us to get their shots. It is extremely inconvenient," said Prahlad Joshi, a passenger. 
 NEW DELHI: It was supposed to be the first janta durbar of Aam Aadmi Party after coming to power but it never took place. A group of 35 teachers from Rohini who had come to meet Arvind Kejriwal and his ministers at Delhi Secretariat were left waiting as no one turned up. Finally, health minister Girish Soni came, only to address the media waiting there.  The teachers are from the same private school and had earlier gone to court against the administration for not receiving their allowances. Despite a court judgment on October 29 in their favour, the teachers havenât got revised salaries. âWe are paid as per 6th pay commission and donât get salaries on time. Other allowances are also not paid. When we complained to the Congress government, the school administration suspended five teachers. The court judgment is in our favour but the administration is not following it,â said Neelam, a teacher.  Some of them came all the way from Pooth Kalan, approximately 23km away from Delhi Secretariat, using public transport. Even the light showers and chilly breeze in the morning didnât deter them.  The teachers who arrived at Delhi Secretariat at 9am waited till 11.30am and finally decided to leave their memorandum at the Secretariat gate. They, however, met the personal secretary of education minister Manish Sisodia, who promised them an appointment soon.  âHe (Soni) couldâve spared two minutes for us after all he is the labour minister. We are here since morning but he had time to only talk to the media and not listen to our grievances. If the janta durbar was cancelled or rescheduled then AAP shouldâve announced it,â said Neelam. Another teacher said, âThe guards at the secretariat are asking us to move from one gate to another. We know they (AAP leaders) have a lot of work to do but our problems are also important.â  When asked if they will come again for janta durbar, the teachers said they will not wait for another public meeting and will try to take an appointment with the CM. 
 NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has said it cannot give compensation to the cop killed in the Ghitorni incident as he was under deputation to the excise department for the last one year. This, however, is separate from the Rs 1 crore announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as relief to the family of constable Vinod Kumar, who died in the line of duty. Senior cops said compensation under the martyrsâ fund was not applicable in this case as the Kumar was in the payroll of the Delhi government.  âWe would be happy if compensation is given to all the men who lose their lives in the line of duty, but we have to follow the norms in certain cases,â said a senior police officer.  His family members, who live in Muzzaffarnagar, said they were happy with the CMâs offer but would be happier if Kumar was honoured as a martyr.  Meanwhile, the south district police are working on nabbing the suspected bootleggers who assaulted the constable and have arrested two people. 
 NEW DELHI: While political alliances are yet to firm up for 2014 polls, the Election Commission (EC) has already entered a key partnership with US-based internet giant, Google, to help it manage online voter registration and facilitation services ahead of the democratic exercise. Over the next six months, Google will offer EC its resources, including its search engine, to enable voters to check their enrolment status online and locate their polling station, complete with directions using Google Maps.  The âarrangementâ between EC and Google is learnt to have been clinched late this month, and is expected to be âoperationalâ by the second week of January. As part of the partnership, Google will put its worldwide network and resources at the Commissionâs disposal until June 2014 to help it manage online registration of new voters and allow the enrolled ones to check the address at which they are registered, and get directions to the polling station. With the new rolls with reference to January 1, 2014, slated to be out by January 6, the votersâ queries on the Commission website are likely to be managed by Google starting from the second week of January.  Google will not charge the EC for these services, estimated to cost $50,000 (over Rs 30 lakh), and fund the same from its corporate social responsibility (CSR) budget.  âThe EC is going ahead with the use of hi-tech and professional expertise to manage online enrolment of voters and search a voterâs name in electoral rolls along with the polling station. âSo, all that one needs to do now is to type his name/EPIC no and address on the Google Search engine, which will promptly generate results matching the votersâ name with his assembly/Lok Sabha constituency, and pinpointing the location of his polling stationâ¦in fact, Google Maps will give exact directions to the voter on how to get to the correct polling station on the polling day,â explained a senior EC official.  Google is offering similar services across 100 countries as part of its CSR obligations. The American firm had approached the EC some time ago to offer its expertise for better management of online services on the Commissionâs website, particularly voter enrolment and facilitation. The Commission, which felt that the management of its online interface with the voters left much scope for improvement, welcomed the offer from the âglobal leaderâ and the two signed on the dotted line recently.  EC is also exploring the option of using the worldwide network and servers of Google for dissemination of results for the 2014 general election likely to be held in May. EC had tied up with US-based IT firm Akamai for putting out results for the recent assembly polls in five states. The use of 272 servers of Akamai across the world to disseminate the results, as against barely two servers in use during the 2009 Lok Sabha poll, ensured that the ECI website could handle the millions of hits it received per minute on the counting day (December 8). 
 BHOPAL: Chairman of Maharishi Vidya Mandir who was arrested for raping a school teacher for 15 years is refusing to cooperate with the Madhya Pradesh police.  Girish Chandra Varma was arrested from Bhopal on Friday. Police sources said Varma is refusing to cooperate during interrogation and threatened ‘maun vrat’ (ritual of silence) from Tuesday. Varma started meditating once questioned. He kept murmuring that he’s a man of God and should not be harassed.  On Tuesday, police took Varma to his ashram and seized an Audi car, his passport and other documents. The rape survivor accompanied cops for spot verification of the ashram quarters where she alleged she was regularly raped.  Hundreds of Varma’s supporters were performing yagna for his well-being when a police team entered the ashram. His supporters thronged the entry gates when the police convoy entered the ashram.  The police team remained on the campus for over three-and-half hours between noon and 4 pm. “I have never seen such an opulent ashram with so much frills and extravagance,” a police officer said.  Police said they could not find anything incriminating that suggested atrocities alleged by the complainant.  The complainant’s husband told TOI that the police were trying to shield Varma and had even forced his wife to sign on a blank paper on Monday.  Varma would be produced in court after his police remand ends on Wednesday. His lawyers are planning to move his bail application at an appropriate time. 
 BHOPAL: A four-seater private aircraft, belonging to an NRI businessman, made an emergency landing on National Highway-69 at Betul in Madhya Pradesh, following rough weather on Tuesday morning.  Pilot of the Cessna VT aircraft of businessman Sam Verma, send an SOS about an emergency landing and police were deployed to clear the highway to facilitate landing on the road near Milanpur village.  Traffic on the highway was disrupted for about two hours at about 9.40am. Trouble started at 8.30am when the pilot, Jacob, informed its owners about landing hurdles following change in wind direction.  Verma, a resident of US, owns a tyre manufacturing factory, in Milanpur village of Betul district, and has a private airstrip near the spot where the plane made the emergency landing.  Talking to TOI, Verma said, âThe trouble occurred due to the 110-ft lighting towers installed by NHAI at a distance of 650m from the airstrip. This is illegal because as per norms towers of that height should not be constructed near an airstrip.â  Norms say for every 100m distance from a runway or airstrip, an incremental rise of 3.33% height of a tower is allowed, thus at a 650m distance, towers of only 20-22m height could be constructed but NHAI officials have set up five towers of 110m height, Verma claimed.  âThe condition is such that whenever the wind direction is easterly there will be a risk in landing or takeoff. The airstrip has been in existence for the last 15 years but the towers were put up in October despite objections. I have also filed a case in the court of the district collector regarding the issue, but nothing has been done for the past three months,â he said.  However, district administration officials refuted his claims. Collector Betul, Rajesh Kumar Mishra said, âIf the plane could take off from there it could have easily landed. Lighting towers donât have much to do with itâ. 
RAIPUR: After recently claiming that Taxila was in Bihar, BJP's PM-in-waiting Narendra Modi committed another faux pas by saying that Chhattisgarh was more prosperous than Jharkhand at the Sunday rally in Ranchi. Modi was not aware that ground reality. Development indices show Jharkhand to be more prosperous with a higher per capita income and a lower percentage living below poverty line. Modi had proudly claimed while the two states were formed in the same year, "Jharkhand remained poor despite being rich in natural resources and BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh had sped ahead on the development path". The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) report of the Planning Commission shows that Jharkhand has a lower poverty rate and a higher per capita income compared to Chhattisgarh. According to the Planning Commission report (2011-2012), released this year only, the per capita income in Chhattisgarh is Rs 738 (rural) and Rs 849 (urban), as compared to Rs 748 and Rs 974 respectively in Jharkhand. The per capita expenditure in Chhattisgarh is Rs 904.04 (rural) and Rs 1776.21 (urban) as compared to Rs 919.59 and Rs 1894.41 respectively in Jharkhand. And the number of people living below poverty line in Chhattisgarh is 39.93% as compared to 36.96% in Jharkhand. Talking to TOI, Dr Ravindra Brahme, Prof Economics, Ravi Shankar University, said, distribution of income in Chhattisgarh is unequal. "Those who have income and assets are getting richer, others are not benefiting," he said. CRISIL Research's recent report also dubbed Chhattisgarh capital, Raipur, as 'poorest' in terms of ownership of durable assets. CRISIL Research, the country's largest independent and integrated research house, recently released the prosperity index to compare living standards of various states. CRISIL dubs a prosperous state as one that has a high proportion of households owning four durable assets - television, computer/laptop, telephone/mobile phone and two-wheeler/car/jeep. Believe it or not, Jharkhand is better off than Chhattisgarh as it occupies the 10th position among 16 states, with Punjab on the top with a score of 100. In contrast, Chhattisgarh is second last on 15th position with a score of 76.9 and is better than Madhya Pradesh. CRISIL report states that Raipur along with Patna "are the worst in terms of asset ownership as these cities have the highest proportion of households with none of the assets (around 1 in 4 households). These cities also have the lowest proportion of households with all the assets (less than 1 in 16 households). Prof JL Bhardwaj, former head of department, (Economics), Ravi Shankar University, said even the NSS report of July 2011- June 12 shows that Chhattisgarh has the highest poverty and unemployment and is marginally better only to Orissa. He said people of the state were not benefitting from government welfare schemes.
BILASPUR: Information technology and engineering department students of Guru Ghasidas Central University (GGU) have made a prototype of a balloon-powered car that will run on air. The car was developed at a workshop held at the university on the basis of a research paper published by NASA, GGU spokesperson Dr Anupama Saxena said. Explaining the technical aspects, she said an air-filled balloon is tied to the car and it air powers the car to move. She said the technical details of car were explained to students. Saxena said GGU is set to organize a techno fest ' Equilibrio' in January.
RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (CSCDRC) has set aside the order of the district forum, Mahasamund, directing Fellowship School of Nursing to refund fee of Rs 10,000 charged from a student, who lost an academic year, as she was not informed about schedule of classes by the school authorities on time. Accepting the appeal filed by the nursing school, the commission stated that the order passed by the district forum is not sustainable in the eye of law. Consumer commission, in its order, stated that the initial admission fee deposited by the student was non-refundable as per rules. Therefore, student was not entitled to receive refund of fee on the ground that she had not received information on schedule of classes. Moreover, the seat was kept vacant for the academic year 2011-12 by the school. Seema Sahu, a resident of Mahasamund had taken admission in the school of nursing for the course of Auxiliary Nursing Mid-wife (ANM) for the academic session 2011-12. She had paid an initial admission fee of Rs 10,000 and nursing school assured her to inform when classes would begin, but did not do so. When she contacted school of nursing, they didn't give any satisfactory reply. Therefore, she was unable to take training classes and lost one academic year. She filed a complaint before Mahasamund district forum. The nursing school filed a reply stating that after depositing initial amount of Rs 10,000, the student had never bothered to complete other formalities. However, the seat was kept vacant for the entire academic year. So, the school had not committed any neglect on its part. The student was responsible for not taking training and was, therefore, not entitled to get admission fee back. After hearing both the parties, district forum partly allowed the complaint's plea and directed the nursing school to refund fee of Rs 10,000 along with interest of at 6% per annum from June 2011 till date of payment and had also awarded cost of litigation of Rs 2,000. Taking a view from judgement passed by national commission in the case of Globsyn Business School vs Mayuri Ghosh 2013, the commission, however, overruled the decision stating that the forum had committed an error in allowing refund of fees to the student.

JAIPUR/Bikaner: A 35-year-old patient on ventilator support at the Intensive Care Unit of Bikaner's Prince Bijoy Memorial Government Hospital died due to power failure on Tuesday. Sources said the ICU's 'A' Wing, where Munna Lal was admitted, had no backup when the power supply was cut around 9am. Lal was shifted to another wing, but it was too late. "In the process of shifting, Munna Lal died. All the four ventilators in the ICU became dysfunctional," said a relative of Lal. Lal was from Ratangarh town of Churu district and had been admitted to the hospital for the past 10 days. He suffered from TB, kidney and liver ailments. Hospital authorities, however, maintained that Lal died almost two-and-a-half hours after being shifted and that his death had nothing to do with the power disruption. "After the power failure, we shifted Lal to another wing within 10 minutes. He died at 11.30am. His death has nothing to do with the power cut," said Dr R D Agarwal, professor of medicine department of the hospital. "Work is on to ensure uninterrupted power supply to all the wings of ICU," said hospital superintendent Dr K K Verma. He confirmed that the rooms and wards affected by the power cut did not have any backup. The district administration has set up a committee to probe the incident. "Soon after the incident, district administration officials rushed to the hospital. I asked them to file a report by Wednesday," said Bikaner district collector Aarti Dogra. The hospital administration has also set up a three-member team to look into the incident. Sources said power disruptions were routine at the hospital.
PUNE: The special court (CBI) here has acquitted a State Bank of India (SBI) official and 27 others, including 26 employees of the Ammunition Factory, Khadki (AFK), in an alleged housing loan scam, which occurred between March and July 2002. The main accused, a builder, is facing a separate trial in the matter. On December 23, 2003, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had booked Dinkar Pawar, the then manager of SBI's Dattawadi branch, for conspiring with the builder, Sunil Lazarus Anthony, and middleman, Ravindra Kannan Pillay, to secure illegal gratification for disbursing loans worth over Rs 1.01 crore to 30 AFK employees for a residential flats scheme at survey no 29, Dhanori near Lohegaon. Four of the employees have died since. Anthony is proprietor of Eureka Construction, which floated the scheme. The CBI action was based on a complaint lodged by SBI's deputy general manager (vigilance) M V Rao after a series of internal inquiries by the bank revealed irregularities in the loan process. Pawar faced charges of not following the bank norms and not conducting any pre- or post-loan inspection of the site or verification of documents submitted by the loan seekers. The AFK employees and Pillay were booked for cheating, falsification of documents and forgery as the CBI claimed that they submitted bogus salary slips to secure loans. Some of the employees had secured loans from other banks such as Bank of Baroda, Bank of Maharashtra, United Western Bank and State Bank of Mysore. Special public prosecutor for CBI Ayub Pathan examined a total of 20 witnesses in support of the prosecution case during the trial that took almost eight years and four months to complete. Lawyers Pratap Pardeshi, Sanjay Navgire and Jawaharlal Barmeda appeared for the accused. In his 26-page judgment pronounced on September 22, special judge (CBI) D M Deshmukh cited several gaps in the CBI probe and the prosecution's inability to present apt evidence to prove beyond doubt the charges against the accused. For instance, neither the CBI nor the prosecution placed on record the SBI's three to four internal inquiry reports prior to the lodging of the FIR when the entire case was based on such inquiries. "There is scope to mention that those reports are not favourable to the CBI," the judgment stated. In almost all these inquiries, the authorities confirmed non-compliance of procedures for loan sanction and hence serious irregularities. The court, however, pointed out that barring one prosecution witness, nobody, including the complainant, stated that accused Pawar has committed fraud with the bank. "The evidence on record is not sufficient to hold that Pawar being a public servant misused his official position and deceived the bank or accepted illegal gratification," the court ruled. "The possibility cannot be ruled out that Pawar under belief that the accused loan seekers (AFK employees) are government employees and they will not deceive the bank, accepted the salary slips and sanctioned the loan," the court observed, after establishing that the salary slips were genuine. The court, however, ruled that accused Pawar acted hastily in sanctioning the loans and hence there was negligence on his part. Referring to the AFK employees, the court ruled that there was no evidence that these accused prepared bogus or inflated salary slips and deceived the bank. "They are borrowers but, not beneficiaries. Record indicates that out of the entire loan amount they did not receive even a single paisa. In fact, they have not received possession of flats from the builder for which they borrowed loan," the court held.
JAIPUR: It was apparently pressure from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) which led to the arrest of Jaipur Municipal Corporation's ex-CEO and IAS officer Lalchand Aswal.  Politically well-connected Aswal, who managed to remain off the hook despite several FIRs of corruption lodged against him, was arrested by anti-corruption bureau (ACB) soon after a vigilance team of the Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESI) from Delhi started an investigation in alleged corruption in the civic body.  The ESI had visited JMC on September 19, just a week before Aswal's arrest. It had issued a demand notice to Aswal when it came up that benefits of service tax, ESI and PF were not reaching JMC's nearly 4,000 contractual employees even when they were being paid from the corporation's coffers.  The team's visit was the result of several letters written by mayor Jyoti Khandelwal to Narendra Modi in which she constantly raised the issue of non-payment of ESI to employees and other corrupt practices in the civic body. She had even met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the first week of August. !"It was the pressure from PMO which led to his arrest. Otherwise, the state government was in no mood to bring Aswal to the book despite serious allegations of corruption against him," claimed mayor Jyoti Khandelwal who had announced to sit on dharna if the PMO didn't intervene to stop the corruption in JMC.  Aswal have enjoyed plump posting under both BJP and Congress governments despite having a very controversial career. He was posted as JMC CEO soon after BJP government came to power last year. Likewise, when he was commissioner of JMC and administrator of the civic body in the late 90s and early 20s, nearly seven FIRs were lodged against him. In a couple of cases, the ACB even sought prosecution sanctions, but the then Congress government refused to give its nod. About five more FIRs were closed on account of lack of evidence.  The latest controversy erupted when JMC's executive engineer Purushottam Jeshwani was arrested in front of Aswal's house with Rs 15 lakh on August 14. It was alleged that he was there to give Aswal the money as commission from contractors for issuing tenders of civic works. Nearly four dozen files relating to these tenders were also seized from Jeshwani on the spot. Questions were raised as to why ACB didn't catch Jeshwani handing over the money to Aswal red-handed.  The ACB officials, however, insisted that the agency was working independently. Officials said the ACB had constituted two different committees headed by PHED and PWD's additional chief engineer-rank officers. One committee was probing the irregularities in the tender files that were seized from the engineer. The other committee was analyzing files and documents sized from the JMC's engineering and accounting sections and the CEO's office.  "As soon as we got these committees' reports proving gross financial irregularities in the tender process, we arrested Aswal," said a senior ACB officer. 
JAIPUR: In yet another case of exploitation of children, the city police on Tuesday rescued 41 child labourers, some of whom are as young as eight-years-old. They were confined to three different homes locked from outside in Bhatta Basti where they were made to work in inhuman conditions for zari (embroidery) and bangle manufacturing works. Five men were arrested for human trafficking and child labour.  DCP, north, Ashok Kumar Gupta said that a team of police along with NGO members raided some houses in Bhatta Basti and found these kids aged between 8-17 years working in inhuman conditions. The children were involved in zari work and manufacturing of bangles when police raided the units operating from three small houses. At an age when they should be in school, these children were in work, police said.  "At least 41 kids were compelled to work and sleep in very small rooms. They were not given proper meals and not allowed to sleep for more than six hours," said an officer of Bhatta Basti police station.  The police said a majority of the child labourers are from Bihar and were getting very poor wages. "Most of them belong to very poor families and it is likely that their parents send them to work in such conditions through the agents, who bring these kids from villages," the officer added.  The police have lodged an FIR against Mohammed Javed, Mohammed Rahmat Shaikh, Mohammed Jahid, Shahnawaz and Shiv Shankar alias Daya Shankar who own these bangle manufacturing units.  Moreover, medical test of the children would also be conducted. These children would be sent to their homes in Bihar after completing formalities, the CWC official said. 
JAIPUR: For holistic development of the cities, a two-day workshop on 'Urban Transformation Blueprint' was conducted here. Union urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu inaugurated the workshop on Tuesday. Speaking on the occasion, Naidu stressed on transparency and accountability in the system to provide quality service to urban residents.  With an aim to find practical solutions for development of infrastructures, several proposals were mooted by participants of the workshop. Addressing the delegates, Naidu said, "To provide quality services to the urban people, there should be transparency and accountability in the system".  The minister asked the delegates to find out possibilities on developing satellite towns, heritage cities, malls and special hubs. He also asked officials to work on ring roads, ring railroads (for trains so that they do not enter a city if not required), connectivity of airports to Metro and good networks for tourist destinations.  Chief minister Vasundhara Raje addressing the officials stressed on keeping people in the loop when it comes to development plans. "Taking people into confidence and continuous dialogue with them are necessary for planned urban development. To develop model cities, we need to understand the nature and the local requirement of the cities," Raje said.  She mentioned that better services come with a cost. Raje said there are several proposals but all needs money for effective implementation. "Many big cities of the world including London and New York have an economic model and they follow it for development work. In Rajasthan too, we have to see which model is appropriate for well-planned development of our cities," she said.  Rajasthan government officials presented their vision on how the state is working on public private partnership (PPP) modes to provide good living conditions in cities. The workshop will conclude on Wednesday with Raje providing her inputs to the overall development roadmap of her government to achieve the targets set. 
JAIPUR: Late night talks between the Gujjar leaders and the state government in Jaipur over the 5% quota for the special backward classes (SBC) remained inconclusive on Tuesday. The two sides agreed to meet again on Wednesday in the presence of legal experts to find a way to remove legal hitches in the quota law, stuck in the Rajasthan high court. The litigation over the matter would come up for hearing in the high court on Thursday.  The Gujjars led by Kirori Singh Bainsla have been staging a sit-in at village Ajit Khera Katara Ajij near Hindaun since September 28 to press for their 16-point demands, including the 5% SBC quota. A day earlier, Bainsla threatened to convert the sit-in going on in the rural territory into a protest march towards the urban limits. Before the Gujjars were to start their march on Tuesday morning, apparently towards Hindaun that was 8-km from their stir site, the state government invited them for talks to Jaipur. The government had dispatched BJP MLA from the Gujjar community, Man Singh Gurjar to persuade the protesters for dialogue.  The talks between Gujjars' 11-member delegation, including Bainsla, began at the residence of minister of state for food and civil supplies Hem Singh Bhadana, who too is a Gujjar. Health minister Rajendra Rathore headed the government side. The discussions that started around 7:40 pm lasted for almost three hours, but yielded little result. "The government has indicated its willingness to improve and better implement the Dev Narayan Yojana. For our quota demand, we will again meet tomorrow along with state law secretary and advocate general," Bainsla said."The sit-in at village Ajit Khera Katara Ajij will continue in the meantime," he added. "The talks were held in an amicable environment," said Himmat Singh Gurjar, spokesperson of the Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, which is leading the quota protest.  Minister Rathore said, "We will have another round of talks on Wednesday morning in the presence of legal experts to have a road map to ensure 5% quota for SBC."  The Samiti led by Bainsla called a mahapanchayat near Hindaun on September 28, but turned it into an indefinite sit-in later that day. The community mahapanchayat was called to press for 5% quota in government jobs and educational institutes for the SBC.  The state introduced an Act provisioning 5% quota for SBC in 2008-09 but it was stayed by the Rajasthan high court because total reservation shot beyond the 50% limit set by the Supreme Court. The community blames chief minister Vasundhara Raje for the SBC quota provision getting stuck in the court since the reservation act was drafted and passed by the state assembly during her previous government from 2003 to 2008. During Raje's previous stint there two violent quota agitations in which 70 Gujjars were killed in police firing in 2007 and 2008. 
JAIPUR: At a time when the real estate market is facing a slowdown, the state government on Tuesday has announced to increase the District Lease Committee (DLC) rates by 15% to 30% in the city.  Land prices are set to get more costly near the ring road project too as the government has decided to increase the DLC by 40%. The revised DLC rates will be implemented from October 1.  With this, house prices may once again rise while property purchases may fall in the state capital. According to experts, the increase in DLC rates will not only affect the lower-income group but also make land and flats out of the reach of many middle- and higher-income people as land and its registration prices are bound to rise. Realtors were concerned that the decision came at a time when the prime minister has announced to provide own house to every resident by 2022.  Gopal Das Gupta, member of the Rajasthan Builders' Association said, "The state government should increase the DLC rates in the state after a survey. The DLC rates are determined after seeing the highest rate of property sold in the area. There are many areas where land prices are less than the DLC rates."  He added, "The market is already facing a downturn and commercials properties are purchased as buyers have to pay three times more for registry. After further increase in DLC rates, buying of commercial properties will be discouraged and people will misuse residential structures for commercial activities."  The DLC prices in the city were last increased in the 2012- 2013 budget. At present, buyer purchasing a house in Tilak Nagar pays Rs 19,140 per sqm. It is expected that property rates will increase by at least 30% and buyers have to shell out more money for registry too.  Many feel that developers and promoters will use this as an opportunity to jack up their property rates. For example, even after the revised DLC rates, one yard of residential property in Adarsh Nagar is nearly Rs 19,800 whereas the prevailing market rate is Rs 80,000. But promoters may now hike their rates simultaneously.  Vinay Joshi, another developer said, "At present, the property prices are already high in the city and out of reach of the common people. The state government should have waited before increasing the prices."  Meanwhile, a proposal to make DLC rates higher along the Metro corridor was turned down after facing protest from legislators. It was reasoned that property owners near the corridor are already facing loss during construction of Metro and any increase in DLC will discourage buyers along the corridor.  The district administration has also announced six roads in the city as 100% commercial areas. "It was proposed to announce 10 roads as commercial areas; however, only six were approved considering the fact that residents have to pay higher costs for registry in such a land use change," an official said. 
JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authorityis rapidly moving forward to take complete possession of acquired land for the proposed ring road project.  Till Tuesday, the civic body cleared 37.2 km after razing nearly 50 structures. "On the sixth day, we took possession of land in Yadvo Ki Dhani and Muhana village . The complete possession will happen soon. The authority has deployed huge machinery and manpower to remove the debris and marking the boundary is carried out simultaneously," said a JDA official.  "We took the services of 22 earthmovers, 25 dumpers and nearly 40 tractors. Workers have also been deployed in different zones to removed debris," he said.  The JDA has now taken possession in only nine km area. On Wednesday, the drive will continue in Muhana area.  JDA will take possession of 360 metres, demarcate it and fortify it with trenches . JDA has prepared a 40-day action plan to take possession of 47km for the project. The ring road will be completed in two phases, where Agra Road will be connected with Tonk Road and Ajmer Road in Phase I. The project consists of a six-lane access control expressway, a three-lane service road and an investors' development corridor. "Leveling and demarcation work has been done simultaneously to ensure no further encroachment directions are given for patrolling."  Other than this, the civic body has to take possession of land from housing colonies, more than 600 houses on a km-long patch in Bagrana on Agra Road. The JDA will take the possession of this patch afterwards.  Under the ring road project, the government had proposed a 90-metre-wide transport corridor and 135-metre-wide development corridors on both sides of the transport corridor. Earlier , the idea had, however, not gone down too well with the farmers who were demanding compensation at market price for the 90-metre stretch and return of excess land.  Once constructed, all heavy vehicles will be diverted to the ring road giving a major relief to the city roads. 
JAIPUR: Even as the Jyoti Nagar police began probe in an FIR lodged for misuse of office and providing advertising space flouting norms and tampering with records to favour advertising companies, mayor Jyoti Khandelwal, one of the four accused, claimed innocence on Tuesday. She said that the allegations against her are baseless.  The FIR was lodged on Sunday against Khandelwal, JMC ex-CEO Lalchand Aswal, then revenue commissioner OP Gupta and current revenue commissioner Ramchandra Sharma.  "The file of the firm I was accused of favouring was never presented to me. It has been alleged I had favored the firm. However, in May, a letter from my end was shot to JMC CEO, DLB, director and principal secretary UDH to blacklist the firm but no action was taken. In this regard I have also registered a complaint with the ACB," said Khandelwal.  Despite directions were given not to give further contract to the firm, the hoarding contract was given by finance advisor Munshi Ram, revenue commissioner Ram Charan Sharma and other officials and even the finance committee supported the decision, she said.  "I myself will write a letter to ACB to carry out a probe in this matter," she said. Meanwhile, the police said that the statement of the complainant, Raghunath Singh, will be recorded. In the FIR, Singh said that his firm had won a tender issued by the railways in 2009 for putting up advertisements at Hanspura, Bais Godown, Tonk Road, Saras Dairy, Gopalpura Railway Bridge and some other places. The tender was stayed by the Rajasthan High Court in 2010.  The court lifted the stay on tender in October 2011 asking Singh's firm to apply to the JMC, the FIR says. When Singh's firm applied to JMC and requested the civic body to provide information about license amount, its application was rejected without any hearing. The right of hearing was also rejected in February, 2012. He alleged that advertising rights are given by the JMC without any norms. 
NEW DELHI: The Bangalore trial court appears to have violated the Supreme Court's mandate by convicting and sentencing former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa on the same day, September 27, in a disproportionate assets case. On Saturday, trial judge John Michael D'Cunha convicted Jayalalithaa in the Rs 66.65 crore DA case and also sentenced her to four years imprisonment along with Rs 100 crore fine and confiscation of all seized properties. The conviction verdict and sentence immediately disqualified her as an MLA and consequently as chief minister.  But the Supreme Court in Allauddin Milan vs State of Bihar [1989 SCC (3) 5] had ruled that all trial courts, after pronouncing an accused guilty, must adjourn the hearing on quantum of sentence to another day to enable both the convict and the prosecution to present material in support of the quantum of sentence.  It had said, "As a general rule, the trial courts should after recording the conviction adjourn the matter to a future date and call upon both the prosecution as well as the defence to place the relevant material bearing on the question of sentence before it and thereafter pronounce the sentence to be imposed on the offender."  The court had warned that if a sentencing order was passed by a trial without following the general rule laid down by it, then it might have to be replaced. "A sentencing decision taken without following the requirements of sub-section 2 of section 325 of the Criminal Procedure Code in letter and spirit may have to be replaced by an appropriate order," the SC had said.  "If the choice is made without giving the accused an effective and real opportunity to place his/her antecedents, social and economic background, mitigating and extenuating circumstances etc before the court, the court's decision on the sentence would be vulnerable," the apex court had said.  The SC had said the sentencing court must approach the question (quantum of punishment) seriously and must endeavour to see that all relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of sentence were brought on record.  Only after giving due weight to the mitigating as well as the aggravating circumstances placed before it should it pronounce the sentence, the court had said. 
JAIPUR: The Rajasthan high court on Wednesday completed its hearing on the code of conduct violation during the Rajasthan University elections and has reserved its order. The court held that there has been a gross violation of the Lyngdoh Committee Recommendation and the order of the Supreme Court, which are evident from the photographs submitted by the petitioner and has also been substantiated by police Commissioner Janga Sriniwas Rao's affidavit submmited to the court.  Hearing the petition challenging the university elections conducted on August 23 and announcement of results put on hold by the court, Justice M N Bhandari observed that if such practices continue, such leaders are born out of it would put the country into darkness.  An application was filed by Anil Chopra, who had contested the election for the post of RUSU president, in which he prayed that since the election has been conducted, stay on the result does not serve any purpose. However, advocate for the petitioner objecting to the contention of the candidate submitted that as far as Anil Chopra is concerned, there is an admission from the university in its affidavit that he was among those 13 candidates who violated the code of conduct.  There have been constant demands to bring persons who were in charge of elections under the radar and punish them. It was also argued in courts that the indirect system of election proves to be very tedious. To this, the courts have responded saying that this cannot be a ground and if this method is not deemed suitable, then it was better to have the method of elections be scrapped in entirety because of the high degree of vandalism and bullying. It was observed that such elections are going off track by pushing the youth of the country into taking desperate measures and jeopardize the future of the country.  The court also observed that the university's vice-chancellor had been a silent spectator during the entire election process and should be liable for contempt of Supreme Court's order. "So why not the V-C and other officials concerned be put in jail," Justice Bhandari observed. 
JAIPUR: To achieve the target of 25,000 mega watt (MW) production of solar power in next five years, the state government has finalized amendments in Rajasthan solar policy, 2011. The revised version is likely to be announced and implemented in first week of October.  Among the major changes, the policy will now have a provision of allowing land owners to lease the land for solar producers for a period of 30 years. This period can be extended for 10 more years based on the mutual agreement. To include this provision in the solar policy, state government has already passed amendments in 'Rajasthan Tenancy Act 1955'.  Other important measures taken in the policy are reduction in the net worth of a company planning to set up a project. For example, a company envisaging to install 1 MW plant earlier was required to have Rs 2.5 crore of net worth. This has now been brought down to Rs 1 crore. Similarly, security amount to be deposited too has been brought down to almost 50%.  Under the revised guidelines, for projects up to 10 MW, approving authority will now be the secretary of power department. Earlier, all project approvals were granted by a committee headed by the chief secretary.  "To meet the target, we will have to encourage both small and big ticket projects. For high capacity projects, we will offer customized packages and for small projects there will be easier and more relaxed guidelines," said senior official of Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation (RREC). To expedite the process of commissioning of solar plants, the government has also made the environmental clearance from Rajasthan pollution control board time bound. All  the projects will get no objection certificate in 15 days from the board. Also, developers will have to start construction within three months if land is owned by the government.  However, the government has rolled back on incentives it offers for the project installation of producers. Instead of paying 10% of the DLC rates, the companies will have to pay the actual price of DLC. This is likely to hurt several projects that are in pipeline and increase the cost of the project.  According to officials, all the necessary arrangements have been made for the revised policy. As soon as a nod is given by the chief minister, it will be unveiled and implemented in the state.

HYDERABAD: Declining to intervene in the running battle between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh over ownership of institutions and corporations listed under Schedule 9 and 10 of the AP Reorganisation Act, governor ESL Narasimhan has forwarded the complaints lodged with him by the two states to Union home minister Rajnath Singh.  Sources said the governor has recommended invoking of Section 108 of the Act so that the 'Dispute Resolution Committee' (DRC) would take up the contentious issues that are niggling the two states. The Centre has already appointed the DRC to handle all controversies arising out of sharing of assets and properties between AP and Telangana. The Union home secretary heads the committee which includes the chief secretaries of the two states and the additional secretary in the Union home ministry in his capacity as chairperson of the technical support group on the bifurcation.  Extricating himself from the situation, Narasimhan is said to have suggested to the Union home ministry that the DRC would be the best platform to persuade the two states to arrive at an amicable settlement on the issues on which they are on a collision course. Apparently, the governor cited lack of clarity over his powers under Section 8 of the AP Reorganization Act as the reason for knocking the doors of the Centre."He does not want to act under pressure as there is no clarity on his powers granted under Section 8. In the wake of opposition from the Telangana government, the Union home ministry is also treading cautiously on this issue," said the sources.  The latest spat between the two states was triggered by a letter written by AP chief secretary IYR Krishna Rao last week in which he cited several violations of the AP Reorganization Act by the Telangana government.The TRS regime too wrote to the governor denying the allegations and maintaining that it was following the Act in letter and spirit. It was after examining both the arguments that Narasimhan decided to leave it to the Centre to mediate. According to the sources, the Union home ministry has indicated that a meeting of the DRC would be convened at the earliest.  Meanwhile, the AP government is said to be smarting from the move of the Telangana government to take over the Society for Andhra Pradesh Network (Sapnet), a communication infrastructure initiative of the IT&C department of the united state. It operates three television channels and a dedicated KU Band to run educational programmes across the 23 districts. The TRS regime on Monday issued a GO stating that Sapnet belongs to Telangana as it is located in Hyderabad. 
HYDERABAD: A local court on Tuesday dismissed a plea to grant custody of a Tollywood actress, who was recently caught by city police in a case of immoral trafficking, to her kin and ordered that she be kept in the custody of the state home for the next six months.  The Special Court for Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act case at Erranmazil gave the order while dealing with a petition moved by the mother of the actress.  Advocate Sriram Bhatla Pradeep Kumar, on behalf of the petitioner, during his earlier arguments contented that she was falsely implicated by police during a decoy operation at a star hotel in Banjara Hills.  "The victim is a major and nobody can force her to be in any rehabilitation home and she be handed over to her mother's custody for proper care,'' Pradeep Kumar told the court.  The prosecution, in its argument, said the victim needs rehabilitation and needs to be kept at the home or otherwise, she might repeat the crime. The court also took into consideration the report submitted by the home.  After hearing the arguments and other material, the court directed that the actress be kept at the state home for six months. 
NEW DELHI: While the Enforcement Directorate made its first arrest â of businessman and lawyer Gautam Khaitan â in the Rs 3,600 crore AgustaWestland chopper scam, CBI is still dragging its feet in the case. After 20 months of investigation, CBI is nowhere close to filing the chargesheet despite finishing the probe long back. The agency has been delaying filing the chargesheet on the ground that it is awaiting the outcome of court proceedings in Italy and is yet to receive replies to its letters rogatory â judicial request to assist in probe â from some countries. In fact, a senior officer hinted that "it will not be surprising if the case is closed".  When asked, CBI director Ranjit Sinha said, "We don't even know yet whether we will file a chargesheet or a final report." Apart from filing chargesheet, other aspect of a final report is filing closure report.  CBI had earlier claimed it had established the money trail in the case. It also questioned several former governors -- E S L Narasimhan, M K Narayanan and B V Wanchoo -- and others in connection with the alleged payoffs. The agency received documents on proceedings in an Italian court with the help of the defence ministry and its teams visited Italy twice. In fact, Sinha also visited Italy in this connection once.  According to sources, the LR replies are yet to be received from Tunisia, UK and Mauritius. However, sources said the agency can use the evidence received from Italy and investigations carried out in India to complete its chargesheet.  Much before ED, CBI had filed an FIR against former IAF chief S P Tyagi and others in March 2013 for allegedly receiving kickbacks of Rs 360 crore. Khaitan was named as accused by CBI in its FIR in the AgustaWestland deal, which was later cancelled by the government.  The ED arrested Khaitan under provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after registering an FIR in July.  Both ED and CBI have named almost the same persons as accused in their FIRs.  In its FIR, CBI named Tyagi, his three cousins â Julie, Docsa and Sandeep Tyagi, Satish Bagrodia, brother of former Union minister Santosh Bagrodia, Gautam Khaitan, European middlemen Carlo Gerosa, Christian Michel, Guido Haschke, Guiseppe Orsi and some private companies for criminal conspiracy among other things.  In its FIR, the agency had given details of suspected illegal money transactions of close to 36 million euros, which allegedly came to Indian companies and the Tyagi cousins at different intervals in the garb of âconsultancy' and âengineering' contracts.  CBI alleged that during the tenure of Tyagi and "with his approval", IAF "conceded to reduce the service ceiling for VVIP helicopters from 6,000 meters to 4,500 meters as mandatory to which it was opposing vehemently on the grounds of security constraints and other related reasons earlier".  It had alleged that reduction of service ceiling â maximum height at which a helicopter can perform normally â allowed UK-based AgustaWestland to come into fray. 
HYDERABAD: With junior doctors from state-run allopathy and homeopathy colleges in Telangana going on strike to press for their demands, there is mounting pressure on the government to resolve the crisis as poor patients continue to suffer.  The strike was observed by Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. Roughly, 3,000 patients were affected on Tuesday alone by the boycott of outpatient services, ward treatments and elective surgeries in all teaching hospitals under Osmania Medical College (OMC).  An estimated of 5,000 to 6,000 patients were affected in Warangal, as hundreds of junior doctors boycotted non-emergency services from Gandhi Medical College and Kakatiya Medical College (KMC).  TJUDA's stir is part of a strategy to pressurise the government in doing away with PG counseling for the mandatory one-year rural service, besides other demands like filling up vacancies in government and teaching hospitals, introduction of residential system for students and faculty and special protection force inside teaching hospitals.  To add to the debilitating circumstances, a large contingent of PG students from a Ramanthapur-based government homeopathic medical college laid siege to the office of Andhra Pradesh department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) commissioner KP Srivasuki, demanding release of the state's quota of 58% of the total stipend to junior doctors. Post-bifurcation, the stipend of junior doctors was to be contributed by Telangana and AP governments in the ratio of 42:58 respectively.  "Our stipends running into Rs 1.07 crore for four batches of junior homeopathy doctors are pending for 18 months. Though the Telangana government has released its 42% share of the stipend amounting to Rs 44.96 lakhs, the Andhra Pradesh government is still dilly-dallying," said A Sai Pratap, a junior doctor.  Interestingly, the protest by homeopathy junior doctors outside AP AYUSH commissioner's office was led by LB Nagar TDP MLA R Krishnaiah. "If AP AYUSH department officials cannot solve the just demand of striking junior doctors, there is no need for them to stay in office," R Krishanaiah said.  Meanwhile, despite TJUDA's protest over compulsory rural services, the office of the Director of Medical Education (DME) of Telangana has notified DME Auditorium Hall and Indian Institute of Health and Family Welfare in Koti as the two venues for Wednesday's scheduled counselling to finalise postings of June 2014 passout PG doctors for compulsory rural service.  "If the government decides to go ahead with counselling without addressing our concerns, we will disrupt the counselling process," warned TJUDA president G Srinivas.

HYDERABAD: Just a day after stating that traffic restrictions will be enforced in a "gradual manner" on five road stretches near AOC Centre, the Army authorities have told representatives of residential welfare associations that civilian vehicles will be banned completely on these roads from January 1, 2015.  The shocker came after Army authorities on Tuesday convened a meeting with citizens at Shakti Auditorium of AOC Centre to explain the reasons for civil traffic restrictions on these five roads and the recent High Court order. The representatives, who were waiting to hear the modalities of the night-time restrictions on the five roads which would be between 10 pm and 7 am, were shocked to hear about the complete ban on civilian vehicles from January 1.  General office commanding (GOC), Andhra sub-area, major general CA Pithawalla headed the Army side, while over 100 representatives of residential welfare associations, Malkajgiri Lok Sabha MP Ch Malla Reddy and Secunderabad Cantonment MLA G Sayanna participated in the meeting.

The roads abutting AOC will remain closed from October 2 between 10 pm and 7 am. There will be total restriction on civilian traffic day and night from January 1, 2015."  Malkajgiri MP Malla Reddy, who is also a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence, and MLA Sayanna raised objection stating the move would inconvenience lakhs of citizens commuting on the roads.  Though they requested the Army officials to defer the restrictions till alternative roads were developed, their pleas fell on deaf ears.  "The GOC, Andhra sub-area, suggested a five-member committee of resident welfare associations (RWA) be constituted to avoid inconvenience to general public in view of traffic restrictions to be implemented from October 2," JAC member BT Srinivasan told TOI. The committee would be constituted in a week.  Maj Gen Pithawalla concluded the meeting saying he would oversee relief modalities on restrictions, which would be worked out with the RWA civilian committee once formed.

NEW DELHI: Six Tamil Nadu Liberation Army (TNLA) members who tried to assassinate former Union minister P Chidambaram and Congress leader V Narayanasamy earlier this year by placing bombs near their residences were on Tuesday chargesheeted by National Investigation Agency (NIA) under various sections of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. The involvement of the outfit, called Tamilar Viduthai Padai in Tamil and having its roots in the Naxalite movement, was traced through pamphlets it had thrown claiming responsibility for placing the bombs. The pamphlets denounced the central government and "MNC-oriented economic policies".  NIA sources said the group targeted Narayanasamy and Chidambaram for being symbols of central government power and such policies and was also opposed to the former's support to Kudankulam nuclear plant.  The group placed its first bomb under a car in front of Narayanasamy's residence in Puducherry in January. In February, it placed a similar bomb behind a Reliance store in Madurai. A third bomb was found in March placed near the residence of Chidambaram in Sivaganga. None of these bombs, however, exploded.  The bombs were a unique assembly of explosives with over 30 detonators and a fuse instead of a timer as is used by most terror groups. This had alerted local cops and the NIA about the emergence of a new group.  The group, which carried out explosions at various places in Tamil Nadu through the 1990s, went dormant in the 2000s with several of its members being arrested or killed in encounters. It resurfaced recently by efforts from two old members, identified as Thiruselvam alias Kumar and Kalailingam alias Kalai. The brothers revived the outfit by recruiting Thangaraj, Kaviyarasan, Karthik alias Aadhi and John Martin alias Ilanthanal. All the accused have been chargesheeted.  TNLA seeks an independent nation for the Tamil people, and first appeared in the 1980s, when the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) was sent to Sri Lanka. It had its roots in the Naxalite movement, and was headed by Thamizharasan, an engineering student from Ponparappi village. TNLA was involved in minor bomb blasts, murders and looting banks, which it used to fund its activities.  On September 1, 1987, the people of Ponparappi village lynched Thamizharasan and four of his associates when they attempted to rob a bank. After his death, the group is believed to have splintered into factions. TNLA was banned by the Tamil Nadu government, and later by the Centre in 2002. 
 MUMBAI/JAMMU: Itâs open war between former allies Congress and NCP. A day after Sharad Pawar blamed Rahul Gandhi and Prithviraj Chavan for âmarginalizing Congressâ partnersâ, Sonia Gandhi said in J&K, âNeither because of me nor Rahul Gandhi has the alliance between Congress and NCP broken up.â  On Monday, Pawar had also lashed out at former CM Chavan saying had he shown the same urgency in clearing files earlier as he had done in the last one month, the situation in the state would have been different.  Chavan hit back on Tuesday, attributing Presidentâs rule in the state to a âhidden alliance between BJP and NCPâ. 
NEW DELHI/BEIJING: With both India and China "confirming" that the troop faceoff at Chumar and Demchok in eastern Ladakh was "successfully terminated" at a flag meeting led by major-generals on Tuesday afternoon, the two countries will now hold a meeting on October 16-17 to discuss measures to prevent such border flare-ups. The Indian side at the meeting of the âworking mechanism for consultation and coordination on border affairs (WMCC)', to be held in New Delhi, will be led by joint secretary (East Asia) in the external affairs ministry and include representatives from the military, paramilitary and intelligence agencies.  This decision came after the fifth flag meeting at Spanggur Gap on Tuesday reviewed the complete disengagement and withdrawal of rival troops from their "forward deployments" in Chumar and Demchok. The Indian military delegation was led by 3 Mountain Division commander Major-General A S Bedi.  Under the understanding to "restore the status quo ante as it existed on September 1", China will not extend the road it was trying to construct in the "disputed area" in the Chumar sector. India, in turn, will demolish the recently-built observation hut at Tible in the sector and refrain from building bunkers there, as was reported by TOI last week.  The military standoff, with around 1,000 soldiers from each side in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation for over a fortnight, had been triggered after Indian troops prevented People's Liberation Army troops equipped with cranes, bulldozers and other equipment from building the road.  After hectic diplomatic and military negotiations, the fourth flag meeting on September 25 had decided that the "phased troop withdrawal" from Chumar and Demchok would be completed by September 30.  The Chinese foreign ministry, in a statement issued in Beijing, said the simultaneous troop withdrawal had taken place after a consensus between the two countries "on properly resolving the recent standoff".  This is the first time that China has admitted there was a border standoff. Till now, the official line from Beijing was that the border has not been demarcated, and therefore one could not talk about any intrusion or standoff.  Beijing said both sides understand that friendly cooperation conforms to their common interests, with peaceful and tranquil borders being important for the growth of bilateral relations. India and China had the determination, wisdom and capability to jointly maintain peace and stability of the border areas to create a sound environment for the expansion of bilateral relations, it said.
