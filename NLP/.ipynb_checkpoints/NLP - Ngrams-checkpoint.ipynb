Even as commissioner of police Bhupendra Dak inspected the city areas along with DCPs, official said that special focus was given to put a check on drunk driving. Policemen equipped with breathalyzers and interceptors were ready to catch hold of people driving in inebriated condition while passing through various areas in the city. \"We are checking people, mostly youngsters for driving under the influence of alcohol on New Year Eve. All of them are being booked under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Their vehicles were seized and they are now to appear in courts concerned,\" said a senior police officer. Police added that these defaulters will either have to pay a fine or get at least three years of imprisonment. \"Altogether 500 people driving vehicles including cars and bikes were caught at different places and their vehicles were seized on Monday night alone. Several others were penalized for high speed and for driving without helmets,\" the officer said. However, rowdies took the arrangements for granted and smashed the windows of a car parked near Gaurav Tower, Malviya Nagar area on Monday night.'''"
